Their exceptional martial arts skills allows them to reach the highest rank within the imperial guards. After a successful attempt to kill a Japanese troop leader, the Emperor orders Ying to escort the Golden Wheel of Time from Sindu back to the capital, which is said to have the power of time travel and foresee into the future. From the correspondence between Japanese and Ming officials seized from the mission, Mr. Tu - the Chief of National Defence - reveals that he can identify the traitor by the handwritings. On the way of escorting the Golden Wheel of Time in the snow, Ying is surprisingly confronted by Sao, Yuanlong and Niehu. They inform Ying the news of the murder of Tu&amp;#39;s family with Ying as the killer. The Emperor believes that Ying killed Tu in order to conceal his identity as the traitor, and orders to have Ying and his clan killed. With the Trio sent out to catch Ying, a separate troop is sent to Taoyuan to kill the villagers. From the evidence presented to Ying, he comes to the conclusion that the traitor has to be one of the trio and also the one behind the ruthless killing. Desperate to save the Taoyuan villagers, Ying chooses to fight his way out. The intensity of the duel has shaken the earth causing an avalanche that buries the four during the heat of battle. Now in 2013, Squire Tang, funded by a mysterious financer, digs up Ying, Sao and Niehu. As he is transferring the icemen to Hong Kong for further studies, the vehicle is involved in a traffic accident which, unexpectedly, defrosts Ying. Frozen for 400 years arriving to modern day Hong Kong, Ying accidentally meets an intoxicated woman named May on Halloween evening, who later gives him shelter. With his intelligence and hard-work, Ying soon becomes more familiar with the idea of modern society with the help of the internet. While adapting to his new life, Ying and May also gradually starts to fall for each other. Ying still never forgets about the injustice that framed him. He comes across a historical record on the internet stating that he plotted a revolt which branded him with the reputation of a traitor in history. However, there is no information regarding the fate of the villagers. For Ying to correct history, he must use the Golden Wheel of Time. However, Sao and Niehu are now also reanimated at present time. They continue to take up the chase they left behind in the past, eventually leading to several showdowns around Hong Kong.","country":"China, Hong Kong","language":"Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Hindi","imdbid":"tt2557256"},"mgname":["Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","International Movies","Epics","International Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Chinese Films","International Action & Adventure","Sci-Fi Adventure","Asian Movies","Martial Arts Films","Adventures","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["1492","1568","9744","78367","52858","852491","3960","852490","6926","78104","8985","7442","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Donnie Yen","Shengyi Huang","Mark Wu","Baoqiang Wang","Singh Hartihan Bitto","Suet Lam","Kang Yu","Simon Yam","Yu Kang","Wang Baoqiang","Lam Suet"]},{"creator":["Fung Lam","Mark Wu"]},{"director":["Wing-cheong Law","Law Wing-cheong"]}],"country":[]}}

But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet-or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), to help with her family troubles.","country":"USA, Australia, UK","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1077368"},"mgname":["International Comedies","Comedies","International Movies"],"Genreid":["852492","6548","78367"],"people":[{"actor":["Chloe Grace Moretz","Helena Bonham Carter","Michelle Pfeiffer","Johnny Depp","Bella Heathcote","Eva Green","Gulliver McGrath","Jonny Lee Miller","Christopher Lee","Jackie Earle Haley","Ray Shirley"]},{"creator":["Seth Grahame-Smith","John August","Dan Curtis"]},{"director":["Tim Burton"]}],"country":[{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2017-09-23","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["English","Polish"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Portugal ","ccode":"pt","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Portuguese"],"cid":"268","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["English","Russian"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2016-02-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Spain ","ccode":"es","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","European Spanish"],"subs":["English","European Spanish"],"cid":"270","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

The parents have passed their ideals to their children, namely socialism (in its various forms) and survivalism. With the former, Ben considers most of western society as being fascist, especially corporate America. With the latter, he figures that no one will or should be there for you, so you better learn how to take care of yourself in all its aspects. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training, know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains and even fractures, and know how to hunt, forage and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie&amp;#39;s health. Formerly a lawyer, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben figures that this disorder started with her post-partum depression with Bo. Even with this lifestyle, Leslie&amp;#39;s condition has become progressively worse. Despite not believing in western medicine, Ben, to deal with the illness, has sent Leslie to hospital, one close to Ben&amp;#39;s sister, Harper, in Sacramento so that there can be family close by. While in hospital, Leslie is able to commit suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie&amp;#39;s act brings out a battle between Ben, and Leslie&amp;#39;s father, Jack Bertrang, a wealthy Christian, who not only blames Ben for what happened to Leslie, but believes what he is doing to the children can legally be considered abuse. To be held in their church in New Mexico, Jack takes over the funeral arrangements to his and his complacent wife Abby&amp;#39;s Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie&amp;#39;s wishes, she who believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, he and the children believe it is the latest of their missions to rescue Leslie to honor her last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophies. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long seated issues within the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he who may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.","country":"USA","language":"English, Esperanto","imdbid":"tt3553976"},"mgname":["Independent Comedies","Cannes Film Festival Award-winning Movies","Award-winning Movies","Comedies","Independent Movies"],"Genreid":["4195","846810","89844","6548","7077"],"people":[{"actor":["Nicholas Hamilton","Ann Dowd","Missi Pyle","Steve Zahn","Samantha Isler","George MacKay","Trin Miller","Annalise Basso","Kathryn Hahn","Frank Langella","Erin Moriarty","Viggo Mortensen","Charlie Shotwell","Shree Crooks"]},{"creator":["Matt Ross"]},{"director":["Matt Ross"]}],"country":[{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"}]}}

Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Cambridge, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and, ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul.

Waters and his elite squadron of tactical specialists are forced to choose between their duty and their humanity, between following orders by ignoring the conflict that surrounds them, or finding the courage to follow their conscience and protect a group of innocent refugees. When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0314353"},"mgname":["Dramas","Military Dramas","Action Thrillers","Military Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5763","11","43048","2125","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Bruce Willis","Johnny Messner","Chad Smith","Eamonn Walker","Tom Skerritt","Charles Ingram","Malick Bowens","Monica Bellucci","Cole Hauser","Nick Chinlund","Paul Francis","Awaovieyi Agie"]},{"creator":["Alex Lasker","Patrick Cirillo"]},{"director":["Antoine Fuqua"]}],"country":[{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"}]}}

Travers&amp;#39; Mary Poppins (1964), he made them a promise - one that he didn&amp;#39;t realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney&amp;#39;s plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn&amp;#39;t budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.","country":"USA, UK, Australia","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2140373"},"mgname":["Dramas","Biographical Dramas","Comedies","Dramas based on real life"],"Genreid":["5763","3179","6548","3653"],"people":[{"actor":["Emma Thompson","Tom Hanks","Annie Rose Buckley","Colin Farrell","B.J.

Soon after his fianc&eacute;e Carla Pestalozzi announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack. Womack tells Stanley that San Francisco&amp;#39;s Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel who, for years, has been protesting the government&amp;#39;s refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he&amp;#39;s holding hostages in order to get his point across. Stanley is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Stanley knows how to disarm the bombs, but Stanley needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside. That man is former British intelligence agent John Patrick Mason, who has been in prison for the past 30 years without a trial because he was accused of stealing the private files of J. Edgar Hoover. In 1962, John became the only inmate ever to escape from Alcatraz, and he stayed out of Alcatraz long enough to father a daughter named Jade Angelou. Despite his extreme hatred of the FBI, John agrees to help Stanley. When John and Stanley are sent into Alcatraz with a Navy SEAL team, General Hummel&amp;#39;s men kill the entire SEAL team, leaving Stanley and John to work on their own to rescue the hostages.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0117500"},"mgname":["Action Thrillers","Action & Adventure","Crime Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["43048","1365","9584"],"people":[{"actor":["Sean Connery","Nicolas Cage","Ed Harris","John Spencer","William Forsythe","David Morse","Vanessa Marcil","Michael Biehn","Gregory Sporleder","John C.

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than &amp;#39;Riggan Thomson&amp;#39; the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carver&amp;#39;s story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggan&amp;#39;s biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2562232"},"mgname":["Independent Dramas","Dramas","Independent Films","Showbiz Dramas","Independent Comedies","Comedies"],"Genreid":["384","5763","7077","5012","4195","6548"],"people":[{"actor":["Michael Keaton","Emma Stone","Kenny Chin","Jamahl Garrison-Lowe","Zach Galifianakis","Edward Norton","Merritt Wever","Naomi Watts","Andrea Riseborough","Amy Ryan","Lindsay Duncan","Jeremy Shamos"]},{"creator":["Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu","Alexander Dinelaris","Raymond Carver"]},{"director":["Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu","Alejandro G.

The wedding itself proves to be anything but a hasty affair--the guest list quickly blooms from 75 to 200 guests, and Carrie&amp;#39;s simple, label-less wedding gown gives way to an enormous creation that makes her look like a gigantic cream puff. An upcoming photo spread in Vogue puts the event--which will take place at the New York Public Library--squarely in the public eye. Meanwhile, Carrie&amp;#39;s girlfriends--Samantha, the sexpot; Charlotte, the sweet na&iuml;f; and Miranda, the rigid perfectionist--could not be happier. At least, they couldn&amp;#39;t be happier for Carrie. Charlotte still has the unrealized hope of getting pregnant. Samantha is finding a loving, committed relationship more grueling than she could have imagined. Miranda unwittingly lets her own unhappiness--created when Steve admits to cheating on her just once--spoil Carrie&amp;#39;s. After a heated encounter with Steve, she happens to spot Mr. Big and tells him he&amp;#39;s crazy to get married. She&amp;#39;s really only thinking of her own marriage. But her angry remark gets Mr. Big to thinking.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1000774"},"mgname":["Steamy Romantic Films","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Comedies","Comedies","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["35800","502675","5475","6548","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Kristin Davis","Evan Handler","Jennifer Hudson","Mario Cantone","Cynthia Nixon","Chris Noth","Lynn Cohen","Kim Cattrall","Sarah Jessica Parker","David Eigenberg","Candice Bergen","Jason Lewis"]},{"creator":["Michael Patrick King","Candace Bushnell","Darren Star"]},{"director":["Michael Patrick King"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-12","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Australia ","ccode":"au","seasons":"","new":"2019-04-24","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"23","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2016-04-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["English","French"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-23","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-20","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Lithuania ","ccode":"lt","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"357","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2017-09-23","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["English","Polish"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["English","Russian"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-02","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-20","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

This documentary by award-winning filmmaker Marc Levin (SLAM, Mr. Untouchable, Brick City) exposes how the infiltration of crack cocaine destroyed inner-city neighborhoods across the country. At the center of it all is the rise, fall and redemption of Freeway Rick Ross, a street hustler who became the King of Crack, and journalist Gary Webb, who broke the story of the CIA&amp;#39;s complicity in the drug war. Featuring exclusive interviews with Freeway Rick Ross, not to be confused with the rapper who took his name Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb, his source Coral Baca, and wife Susan Webb former Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff Roberto Juarez drug trafficker Julio Zavala and many more. The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection.

One day, EVE, a sleek (and dangerous) reconnaissance robot, is sent to Earth to find proof that life is once again sustainable. WALL-E falls in love with EVE. WALL-E rescues EVE from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble.

One day a massive ship comes to reclaim EVE, but WALL-E, out of love or loneliness, hitches a ride on the outside of the ship to rescue EVE. The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated Earth 700 years earlier. The people of Earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move. When the auto-pilot computer, acting on hastily-given instructions sent many centuries before, tries to prevent the people of Earth from returning by stealing the plant, WALL-E, EVE, the portly captain, and a band of broken robots stage a mutiny.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0910970"},"mgname":["Family Features","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Family Feature Animation","Family Comedies","Family Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Films for ages 5 to 7"],"Genreid":["51056","1492","51058","52847","52849","783","561","5455"],"people":[{"actor":["Ben Burtt","Elissa Knight","Jeff Garlin","Lori Alan","Kathy Najimy","Fred Willard","MacInTalk","Sigourney Weaver","John Ratzenberger","Bob Bergen"]},{"creator":["Andrew Stanton","Pete Docter"]},{"director":["Andrew Stanton"]}],"country":[{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2018-03-02","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Malay","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Korean"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-18","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Malay","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Outwardly Charles built it so that they can spend time there to reconnect as a family, but they all know that he really built it to support the business. They as a family have long not been happy, as workaholic Charles is always concerned the company is close to folding, especially if he doesn&amp;#39;t keep an eye on matters, while Judith feels like he treats their entire family as second priority to the work and the associated money and material wealth. They make it to the cabin just before a major snowstorm hits the area. They receive a surprise knock on their door from the Tuckers - parents Joe and Amy, and their two children, fifteen year old Robbie and fourteen year old Lucie - who ran off the road in their van on their way to a day ski trip, they who need shelter until the storm blows over. Unlike the Montgomerys, the Tuckers are a loving, happy family, who support each other as a family unit. The Montgomerys and the Tuckers do bond during their confined time together, but the sheer presence of the Tuckers may not be enough in and of itself to demonstrate to the Montgomerys what they need to do to avert the break-up of their family.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt4480940"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Family Dramas","Children & Family Films","Family Features"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","31901","783","51056"],"people":[{"actor":["Catherine Lough Haggquist","Nick Purcha","Colin Lawrence","Lizzie Boys","Kolton Stewart","Chris Potter","Jaeda Lily  Miller","Kristy Swanson"]},{"creator":["Kenneth Atchity","Chi-Li Wong","Julie Brazier","Rexanne Becnel"]},{"director":["George Erschbamer"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Now, with only the support of Gen&amp;#39;s teenage brother, a hunky Zamboni driver, Casey takes on the challenge of her life when she finds herself competing against the best to make it into the championship circuit and become a real &amp;#39;ice princess.&amp;#39;","country":"USA, Canada","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0396652"},"mgname":["Dramas","Family Features","Family Comedies","Sports Comedies","Sports Dramas","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Teen Dramas","Comedies","Teen Comedies","Sports Films","Family Dramas"],"Genreid":["5763","51056","52847","5286","7243","783","561","9299","6548","3519","4370","31901"],"people":[{"actor":["Joan Cusack","Amy Stewart","Steve Ross","Michelle Trachtenberg","Kim Cattrall","Hayden Panettiere","Kirsten Olson","Trevor Blumas","Connie Ray","Jocelyn Lai","Brian Boitano","Courtney Hawkrigg","Erik King","Paul Sun-Hyung Lee","Kevin Jubinville","Juliana Cannarozzo","Diego Klattenhoff","Michelle Kwan"]},{"creator":["Hadley Davis"]},{"director":["Tim Fywell"]}],"country":[{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-31","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"}]}}

Participants are flown to Los Angeles first class, paid $1,500, and put up for four nights in a luxury hotel. Suitable participants are deemed to be younger, muscular males. The event is held on a monthly basis. In contacting the organizers, US-based Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media, via their popular Facebook to arrange for an interview, David receives a return message from one of their representatives, Debbie J. Kuhn, declining the offer, the message a homophobic rant largely against David. In that message, Debbie asserts that the competition is wholly a heterosexual athletic activity, she who does not appreciate what will be David&amp;#39;s assumed gay bent on the story as a homosexual himself (which David does not state he is or isn&amp;#39;t in his request). David finds the message all the more odd as the activity as it appears in the videos has an undeniable gay vibe. What is even more odd is that Debbie on behalf of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien, continually emails David over the following weeks expounding on the themes in the original message. At this time, David&amp;#39;s friend, Dylan Reeve, enters the fray, acting initially as a researcher for David, and then eventually as co-filmmaker for a documentary on the subject. However, the documentary eventually morphs from the sport of competitive endurance tickling into the mysterious world of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien and Debbie Kuhn, especially: as they seem to have unlimited resources both to hold the events and to conduct their online harassment they learn not only of David, but of former associates who now seem to want to distance themselves from the &amp;#39;sport&amp;#39; and Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media; as Jane and Debbie initiate legal action and threaten even more legal action, and issue general threats time and time against David and Dylan not only for this unauthorized documentary but for their activities toward Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media as a whole; and as no one seems to know who Debbie or Jane are, even the people that work for them, or what their end goal is. The story takes a further twist when David and Dylan learn there truly is a tickling sexual fetish subculture, one within that community, Richard Ivey, who willingly talks to David and who remembers someone else online decades ago within the community with a similar M.O. to Debbie and Jane.","country":"New Zealand","language":"English","imdbid":"tt5278506"},"mgname":["Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Dylan Reeve","David Farrier","David Starr","Hal Karp"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["David Farrier","Dylan Reeve"]}],"country":[]}}

A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens. While Carol breaks free from the confines of marriage, her husband (Kyle Chandler) begins to question her competence as a mother as her involvement with Therese and close relationship with her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) come to light.","country":"UK, USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2402927"},"mgname":["Dramas","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Dramas","Romantic Films based on a book","Romantic Films","Dramas based on a book"],"Genreid":["5763","502675","1255","3830","8883","4961"],"people":[{"actor":["Kyle Chandler","Sarah Paulson","Carrie Brownstein","Cate Blanchett","Nik Pajic","Jake Lacy","Rooney Mara","Cory Michael Smith","John Magaro","Kevin Crowley"]},{"creator":["Phyllis Nagy","Patricia Highsmith"]},{"director":["Todd Haynes"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"France ","ccode":"fr","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["French"],"cid":"45","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Greek"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2018-04-03","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2017-01-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"}]}}

Elsewhere Officer Warwick accidentally apprehends an innocent mother whom he has erroneously suspected of being a drug addict. Liz&amp;#39;s introductory speech is interrupted by news that a sniper is randomly shooting people around the capital and her disgruntled assistant Finn, annoyed at being passed over for promotion, deliberately makes her look stupid at a press conference by withholding information - as a result of which he is almost sacked. Liz discovers that the sniper is an embittered divorcee who is posting messages on Twitter, from which she locates where he is hiding. The TSG dump Matt to join the stake-out team, who defy Miller by raiding the house, Warwick taking out the sniper.

Taking care of everyone and everything in his own unique way is Susan&amp;#39;s older son Henry, age 11.

Although connected indirectly through Will&amp;#39;s mother/Edward&amp;#39;s wife, Sandra Bloom, Will has been estranged from his father for three years since his and Josephine&amp;#39;s wedding. Will&amp;#39;s issue with his father is the fanciful tales Edward has told of his life all his life, not only to Will but the whole world. As a child when Edward was largely absent as a traveling salesman, Will believed those stories, but now realizes that he does not know his father, who, as he continues to tell these stories, he will never get to know unless Edward comes clean with the truth before he dies. On the brink of his own family life beginning, Will does not want to be the kind of father Edward has been to him. One of those stories from Edward&amp;#39;s childhood - that he saw his own death in the glass eye of a witch - led to him embracing life since he would not have to fear death knowing when and how it would eventually come. The question is whether Will will be able to reconcile Edward&amp;#39;s stories against his real life, either directly from Edward before he dies and/or from other sources, and thus allow Will to come to a new understanding of himself and his life, past, present and future.","country":"USA","language":"English, Cantonese","imdbid":"tt0319061"},"mgname":["Dramas","20th Century Period Pieces","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","Dramas based on a book","Tearjerkers","Dramas based on contemporary literature"],"Genreid":["5763","12739","1492","9744","4961","6384","12994"],"people":[{"actor":["Billy Crudup","Ewan McGregor","David Denman","Robert Guillaume","Loudon Wainwright III","Marion Cotillard","Matthew McGrory","Albert Finney","Helena Bonham Carter","Alison Lohman","Jessica Lange","Missi Pyle"]},{"creator":["Daniel Wallace"]},{"director":["Tim Burton"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Spanish","Italian"],"subs":["Arabic","German","English","Spanish","Italian"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["German","English","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Czech","German","English","Polish"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-28","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["German","English","French","Hungarian","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese","Korean","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Lithuania ","ccode":"lt","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English","Russian"],"cid":"357","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["Arabic","German","Greek","English","Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["German","English","Polish","Russian","Ukrainian"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-02","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Polish"],"subs":["English","European Spanish","French","Hungarian","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Czech","German","English","Hungarian","Ukrainian"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese","Korean"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

She lives at the track with her uncle Eddie, a horse trainer in the race circuit. Danny knows the horses. Danny knows the scams, and just how and when the races are fixed. Danny knows the odds makers-they depend on her for the inside story. And Danny knows that things are going to go nowhere for Uncle Eddie unless he can make his name with one great horse, a horse &amp;#39;you can ride into the money.&amp;#39; Danny has found such a horse. Tom Thumb, a yearling up for sale, has champion potential and she knows it. She isn&amp;#39;t fooled by Noel Ferguson, a big-time trainer who is talking Tom Thumb down. And when Moe Tully arrives in town, Danny knows it can only mean one thing-that races are going to be fixed. But there&amp;#39;s opportunity in that for her. Placing her bets before school and picking up her winnings after, she is soon able to bankroll Uncle Eddie, along with her friend Gerald, a groom at a competing stable who is ready to stake his savings on Tom Thumb. When Danny&amp;#39;s hunch proves correct and Tom Thumb turns out to be a winner, she, Uncle Eddie, and Gerald head off in style for the summer racing season. Other owners seek out the &amp;#39;Bara magic&amp;#39; and for awhile Uncle Eddie can do no wrong. It&amp;#39;s no surprise when Noel Ferguson offers Eddie fifty thousand dollars for Tom Thumb and tells him he&amp;#39;ll take it if he knows what&amp;#39;s good for him. When Eddie refuses, he and Danny, Gerald and even Tom Thumb get a dose of all the dirty dealing the racing circuit can dish out. But Danny, as we&amp;#39;ve seen, is nobody&amp;#39;s fool, and even Uncle Eddie has picked up a thing or two lately. In spite of just about everything that comes their way, they&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;in the money&amp;#39; and it&amp;#39;s one great season on the racing circuit.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0113330"},"mgname":["Dramas","Animal Tales","Children & Family Movies"],"Genreid":["5763","5507","783"],"people":[{"actor":["Erik Jensen","Brian Michael","Ron Brice","Ed Grady","Gary Basaraba","Leelee Sobieski","Karen Carlson","Ed Bruce","Robert Urich"]},{"creator":["Remi Aubuchon"]},{"director":["Dick Lowry"]}],"country":[]}}

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0314353"},"mgname":["Dramas","Military Dramas","Action Thrillers","Military Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5763","11","43048","2125","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Bruce Willis","Johnny Messner","Chad Smith","Eamonn Walker","Tom Skerritt","Charles Ingram","Malick Bowens","Monica Bellucci","Cole Hauser","Nick Chinlund","Paul Francis","Awaovieyi Agie"]},{"creator":["Alex Lasker","Patrick Cirillo"]},{"director":["Antoine Fuqua"]}],"country":[{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"}]}}

During this period, he brought many technical innovations to the developing Tamil Film Industry of the 1930s and &amp;#39;40s, and infused a sense of professionalism into its filmmaking. All this, without understanding a word of the language! Dungan also served the Madras Government in World War II.

Now totally lost in an alien urban environment and too young to identify either himself or his home to the authorities, Saroo struggles to survive as a street child until he is sent to an orphanage. Soon, Saroo is selected to be adopted by the Brierley family in Tasmania, where he grows up in a loving, prosperous home. However, for all his material good fortune, Saroo finds himself plagued by his memories of his lost family in his adulthood and tries to search for them even as his guilt drives him to hide this quest from his adoptive parents and his girlfriend. Only when he has an epiphany does he realize not only the answers he needs, but also the steadfast love that he has always had with all his loved ones in both worlds.","country":"UK, Australia, USA","language":"English, Hindi, Bengali","imdbid":"tt3741834"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Dramas based on real life","Biographical Dramas"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","3653","3179"],"people":[{"actor":["Abhishek Bharate","Sunny Pawar","Rooney Mara","Nicole Kidman","Divian Ladwa","David Wenham","Dev Patel","Priyanka Bose","Khushi Solanki","Tannishtha Chatterjee","Deepti Naval","Nawazuddin Siddiqui"]},{"creator":["Saroo Brierley","Luke Davies"]},{"director":["Garth Davis"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-10","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Canadian French"],"subs":["English","Canadian French"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Greek","English"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2020-01-25","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"","new":"2019-01-20","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection.

The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasts off in search of it. He eventually tracks it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sends him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forces him into a paralyzed state. His body is later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, but before going into a comatose state Megatron uses the last of his energy to engrave into the Captain&amp;#39;s glasses a map showing the location of the Allspark, and to send a transmission to Cybertron. Megatron is then carried away aboard the Captain&amp;#39;s ship. A century later, Captain Witwicky&amp;#39;s grandson Sam Witwicky (nicknamed Spike by his friends) buys his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in disguise who is to protect Spike, who possesses the Captain&amp;#39;s glasses and the map engraved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and Scorponok attack a U.S. military base, causing the Pentagon to send their special Sector Seven agents to capture all &amp;#39;specimens of this alien race.&amp;#39; Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the midst of a grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles.

Anna (Dilip Prabhavalkar), most respected figure of Mangrul, advises him against announcing such personal matter as it&amp;#39;s a question of faith.

She also knows that she is not the beauty typical of the stage performers of the day, she with skinny legs and a crooked nose among other physical issues. So she knows she has to use whatever other means to get her break in show business, that break so that she can at least display her talents. With the help of Eddie Ryan who would become her friend, Fanny is able to get a part in a novelty act in a vaudeville show, the renown from which eventually comes to the attention of famed impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.. Fanny does become one of the Ziegfeld Follies most popular acts, despite she almost getting fired after her first performance by defying Flo&amp;#39;s artistic vision for her closing number. Beyond stage success, Fanny also wants a happy personal life, most specifically with the suave Nicky Arnstein, a gambler in every respect of the word. Fanny loves him and loves that he loves her despite her lack of traditional beauty, but she does not love that he comes in and goes out of her life based on his financial standing at any given time and his need to earn that quick buck by the next poker game or high stakes business deal as he feels he needs to play the traditional role of money maker in their relationship on his own terms.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0062994"},"mgname":["Classic Romantic Films","Comedies","Romantic Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Musicals","Romantic Films","20th Century Period Pieces"],"Genreid":["31273","6548","5475","502675","13335","8883","12739"],"people":[{"actor":["Tommy Rall","Mae Questel","Lee Allen","John Warburton","Lloyd Gough","Walter Pidgeon","Elaine Joyce","Anne Francis","Barbra Streisand","Kay Medford","Gerald Mohr","Frank Faylen","Lester Mack","Omar Sharif","Mittie Lawrence"]},{"creator":["Isobel Lennart"]},{"director":["William Wyler"]}],"country":[{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2019-11-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["English","French"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-11-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","French","Turkish"],"subs":["German","Greek","English","French","Turkish"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2020-01-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Hindi"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"}]}}

A man who lives for his religion, soaked in years of ancient traditions, values and morals. He is a strict, yet lovable man. As any real priest would, Chaturvedi believes he is a disciple of God on this earth to spread God&amp;#39;s message and love as he goes about his rigidly ritualistic world of pooja&amp;#39;s and teachings. One day his daughter brings home an infant (Krish Parekh) and the mother of the infant has disappeared and cannot be found nowhere. Pandit Chaturvedi is hesitant to have the child around the house at first, and when it&amp;#39;s confirmed that the child has been abandoned, he then makes the decision that the child will be raised in the local orphanage. However the Pandit&amp;#39;s wife Parvati (Supriya Pathak Kapur) has by now developed a soft spot for the young child and requests her husband if they can keep and raise the child if as their own. Hesitant at first, the priest reluctantly agrees as his wife lies to him that the baby is the son of a Brahmin. Slowly, the child wins over everyone hearts in the house including Pandit Chaturvedi who finds a son, a disciple and a best friend in the child. The story takes a turn when the baby&amp;#39;s mother returns to claim him back, and much to the shock of Pandit Chaturvedi, the lady is a Muslim. The child who they&amp;#39;d fondly named Karthik is in fact Mustafa. Pandit Chaturvedi is in a state of shock and utter despair as he feels he has done the biggest sin of his life and feel as if he has betrayed his religion and more-so God. In a state of recluse and regret, Pandit Chaturvedi decides to take a series of different vows and &amp;#39;vraths&amp;#39; to clear his conscience. However whilst his mind is telling him he has done a grave sin, his heart sorely misses his little son, and the words &amp;#39;babuji&amp;#39; echo in every corridor of the house. In a series of events, riots break out in the city of Varanasi, Mustafa&amp;#39;s mum begs and pleads the Pandit and his family to take back the little boy as he is much safer with them. However the doors of the house are closed for the little boy. What follows next can only be only described as a journey as Pandit Chaturvedi defies what he has believed his entire life if &amp;#39;religion&amp;#39; and listens to his inner conscience in the rousing finale.","country":"India","language":"Hindi","imdbid":"tt1047459"},"mgname":["International Films","International Dramas","Indian Films","Bollywood Films","Dramas","Musicals"],"Genreid":["78367","852493","10463","5480","5763","13335"],"people":[{"actor":["Pankaj Kapur","Suruchi Aulakh","K.K.

Sea World is about to open a massive &amp;#39;Undersea Kingdom&amp;#39; which will bring visitors closer to marine life than ever before. The park is accessible from the ocean by a series of gates, one of which malfunctions. A young Great White Shark swims through the gate, and when a maintenance diver heads down to fix the gate he does not return. The young Great White is captured &amp; placed in a tank but soon dies despite Kathryn&amp;#39;s best efforts to save it. More alarming though, is the young shark&amp;#39;s massive, 35 foot mother which has followed the baby shark into the lagoon and killed the maintenance diver, whose body is recovered. It isn&amp;#39;t long before the huge shark begins wreaking havoc, and Mike &amp; Kathryn, along with Sea World manager Calvin Bouchard and photographer Phillip Fitzroyce, must find a way to eliminate the shark before they - or the guests - become the shark&amp;#39;s next meal.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0085750"},"mgname":["Horror Films","Action Thrillers","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["8711","43048","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Dennis Quaid","Dan Blasko","Lea Thompson","Louis Gossett Jr.","Bess Armstrong","Liz Morris","John Putch","Simon MacCorkindale","P.H.

Participants are flown to Los Angeles first class, paid $1,500, and put up for four nights in a luxury hotel. Suitable participants are deemed to be younger, muscular males. The event is held on a monthly basis. In contacting the organizers, US-based Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media, via their popular Facebook to arrange for an interview, David receives a return message from one of their representatives, Debbie J. Kuhn, declining the offer, the message a homophobic rant largely against David. In that message, Debbie asserts that the competition is wholly a heterosexual athletic activity, she who does not appreciate what will be David&amp;#39;s assumed gay bent on the story as a homosexual himself (which David does not state he is or isn&amp;#39;t in his request). David finds the message all the more odd as the activity as it appears in the videos has an undeniable gay vibe. What is even more odd is that Debbie on behalf of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien, continually emails David over the following weeks expounding on the themes in the original message. At this time, David&amp;#39;s friend, Dylan Reeve, enters the fray, acting initially as a researcher for David, and then eventually as co-filmmaker for a documentary on the subject. However, the documentary eventually morphs from the sport of competitive endurance tickling into the mysterious world of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien and Debbie Kuhn, especially: as they seem to have unlimited resources both to hold the events and to conduct their online harassment they learn not only of David, but of former associates who now seem to want to distance themselves from the &amp;#39;sport&amp;#39; and Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media; as Jane and Debbie initiate legal action and threaten even more legal action, and issue general threats time and time against David and Dylan not only for this unauthorized documentary but for their activities toward Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media as a whole; and as no one seems to know who Debbie or Jane are, even the people that work for them, or what their end goal is. The story takes a further twist when David and Dylan learn there truly is a tickling sexual fetish subculture, one within that community, Richard Ivey, who willingly talks to David and who remembers someone else online decades ago within the community with a similar M.O. to Debbie and Jane.","country":"New Zealand","language":"English","imdbid":"tt5278506"},"mgname":["Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Dylan Reeve","David Farrier","David Starr","Hal Karp"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["David Farrier","Dylan Reeve"]}],"country":[]}}

As Owen withdrew into his silent state, his parents almost lost hope that he find some way to interact with his world in some meaningful way. However, that way was found through animated films, especially those of the Walt Disney Company, which provided Owen a way to understand the world through its stories to the point of creating his own. This film covers the life of Owen and how he manages to become as functional as possible with the help of Disney and his family to the point of having his own life. However, Owen soon learns as well that there is more to real life than what Disney can illustrate in animation even as his family prepares itself for an uncertain future with him.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt3917210"},"mgname":["Critically-acclaimed Documentaries","Critically-acclaimed Documentaries","Documentaries","Documentaries","Award-winning Movies","Award-winning Movies","Award-winning Movies","Documentaries"],"Genreid":["8673","8673","6839","6839","89844","89844","89844","6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Jonathan Freeman","Gilbert Gottfried","Alan Rosenblatt","Owen Suskind"]},{"creator":["Ron Suskind"]},{"director":["Roger Ross Williams"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2018-04-12","expires":"2020-02-15","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Spanish","Italian"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","French","Dutch"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2017-02-15","expires":"2020-02-15","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Spanish","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2017-02-17","expires":"2020-02-14","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Polish"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"France ","ccode":"fr","seasons":"","new":"2017-04-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Spanish","French","Portuguese"],"cid":"45","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-03","expires":"2020-02-14","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Greek","English","French","Turkish"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2017-02-15","expires":"2020-02-14","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","French","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Polish","Romanian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-13","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Greek","English","French","Italian","Romanian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2017-02-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","Greek","English","Spanish","Italian"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2017-06-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Spanish","French","Dutch","Turkish"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Portugal ","ccode":"pt","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-08","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Spanish","French","Portuguese"],"cid":"268","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-27","expires":"2020-02-14","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Spanish","French","Romanian","Turkish"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"","new":"2017-02-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2017-02-15","expires":"2020-02-14","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Polish"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-27","expires":"2020-02-14","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2017-05-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","French","Italian","Portuguese"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Spanish","French","Dutch","Turkish"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-22","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","English","French","Polish","Portuguese"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after he recognizes his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike&amp;#39;s sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike&amp;#39;s other allies in the office include the firm&amp;#39;s best paralegal Rachel and Harvey&amp;#39;s no-nonsense assistant Donna to help him serve justice. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey&amp;#39;s arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike&amp;#39;s life as difficult as possible.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1632701"},"mgname":["TV Comedies","US TV Programmes","TV Dramas","TV Programmes"],"Genreid":["10375","72404","11714","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Sarah Rafferty","Meghan Markle","Gina Torres","Rick Hoffman","Gabriel Macht","Patrick J.

He and Joey have been painfully estranged ever since Vincent divorced his wife and left the decaying boardwalks of Long Beach, Long Island for the anonymity of Manhattan and a successful career with the NYPD. He lives his life in solitude, keeping his girlfriend at arm&amp;#39;s length; the closest relationship he maintains is with his partner, Reg--and Vincent makes sure that stops at the precinct door. As long as Vincent lives in the protection of the present, he doesn&amp;#39;t have to deal with the pain of his past--or his sorrow over his broken relationship with Joey. But this murder investigation is drawing Vincent home to Long Beach, the self-proclaimed City by the Sea, where the past has been waiting for him to return. The agonizing memory that has tortured him all his life--the death of his father, a convicted murderer who was executed when Vincent was just a boy--still plagues him. In the course of the investigation, he discovers that his own unresolved pain and failures as a father have deeply influenced Joey&amp;#39;s life, and now his 18-month-old grandson may be fated to follow their self-destructive paths.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0269095"},"mgname":["Crime Films","Dramas","Mysteries","Crime Dramas"],"Genreid":["5824","5763","9994","6889"],"people":[{"actor":["Robert De Niro","Frances McDormand","James Franco","Eliza Dushku","George Dzundza","Patti LuPone","William Forsythe","Drena DeNiro","Anson Mount","John Doman","Brian Tarantina","Nestor Serrano"]},{"creator":["Mike McAlary","Ken Hixon"]},{"director":["Michael Caton-Jones"]}],"country":[{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"}]}}

In 1853, the US fleet commanded by Admiral Perry forced the doors open, leading to a modernization of the nation&amp;#39;s sociopolitical systems and the eventual fall of the Shogunate. The samurai regime ended its life with the imperial restoration in 1868. That&amp;#39;s what history tells, but in Gintama, that&amp;#39;s not what happens. Instead of the US fleet, the country is stormed by spaceships coming from four corners of the universe and soon we see it occupied by extraterrestrials. The Shogunate has become a puppet of alien occupation armies. All samurais have been disarmed and reduced to temp workers with no skills who just try to make ends meet. Gintama is a story of a handyman named Gintoki, a samurai with no respect for rules set by the invaders, who&amp;#39;s ready to take any job to survive. He and his gang, however, are also among the very few who have not forgotten the morale of a swordsman. Wherever they go, all they do is to create troubles.

The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection. His story defies all odds and stereotypes and proves that truth is indeed stranger than fiction.","country":"USA, Nicaragua","language":"English","imdbid":"tt3548962"},"mgname":["Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Warren G.","Freeway Rick Ross"]},{"creator":["Marc Levin"]},{"director":["Marc Levin"]}],"country":[]}}

Outwardly Charles built it so that they can spend time there to reconnect as a family, but they all know that he really built it to support the business. They as a family have long not been happy, as workaholic Charles is always concerned the company is close to folding, especially if he doesn&amp;#39;t keep an eye on matters, while Judith feels like he treats their entire family as second priority to the work and the associated money and material wealth. They make it to the cabin just before a major snowstorm hits the area. They receive a surprise knock on their door from the Tuckers - parents Joe and Amy, and their two children, fifteen year old Robbie and fourteen year old Lucie - who ran off the road in their van on their way to a day ski trip, they who need shelter until the storm blows over. Unlike the Montgomerys, the Tuckers are a loving, happy family, who support each other as a family unit. The Montgomerys and the Tuckers do bond during their confined time together, but the sheer presence of the Tuckers may not be enough in and of itself to demonstrate to the Montgomerys what they need to do to avert the break-up of their family.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt4480940"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Family Dramas","Children & Family Films","Family Features"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","31901","783","51056"],"people":[{"actor":["Catherine Lough Haggquist","Nick Purcha","Colin Lawrence","Lizzie Boys","Kolton Stewart","Chris Potter","Jaeda Lily  Miller","Kristy Swanson"]},{"creator":["Kenneth Atchity","Chi-Li Wong","Julie Brazier","Rexanne Becnel"]},{"director":["George Erschbamer"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Anna (Dilip Prabhavalkar), most respected figure of Mangrul, advises him against announcing such personal matter as it&amp;#39;s a question of faith. However, it is too late as a journalist (Kishor Kadam) sensationalizes the news about Lord Dattatrey making an appearance in Mangrul. There is now a demand for a Dattatrey temple. Bhau (Nana Patekar), a political activist, doesn&amp;#39;t approve it as he wants the funds to be used for better purposes but he seems helpless. The temple is built and the village becomes a holy place. Mangrul goes through a 360 degree change due to commercialization but nobody is complaining except Anna. Soon, blinded by the commercial progress, God is forgotten. Every village has a right to progress commercially but how ethical it is to use a temple and its God to achieve it?

A man who lives for his religion, soaked in years of ancient traditions, values and morals. He is a strict, yet lovable man. As any real priest would, Chaturvedi believes he is a disciple of God on this earth to spread God&amp;#39;s message and love as he goes about his rigidly ritualistic world of pooja&amp;#39;s and teachings. One day his daughter brings home an infant (Krish Parekh) and the mother of the infant has disappeared and cannot be found nowhere. Pandit Chaturvedi is hesitant to have the child around the house at first, and when it&amp;#39;s confirmed that the child has been abandoned, he then makes the decision that the child will be raised in the local orphanage. However the Pandit&amp;#39;s wife Parvati (Supriya Pathak Kapur) has by now developed a soft spot for the young child and requests her husband if they can keep and raise the child if as their own. Hesitant at first, the priest reluctantly agrees as his wife lies to him that the baby is the son of a Brahmin. Slowly, the child wins over everyone hearts in the house including Pandit Chaturvedi who finds a son, a disciple and a best friend in the child. The story takes a turn when the baby&amp;#39;s mother returns to claim him back, and much to the shock of Pandit Chaturvedi, the lady is a Muslim. The child who they&amp;#39;d fondly named Karthik is in fact Mustafa. Pandit Chaturvedi is in a state of shock and utter despair as he feels he has done the biggest sin of his life and feel as if he has betrayed his religion and more-so God. In a state of recluse and regret, Pandit Chaturvedi decides to take a series of different vows and &amp;#39;vraths&amp;#39; to clear his conscience. However whilst his mind is telling him he has done a grave sin, his heart sorely misses his little son, and the words &amp;#39;babuji&amp;#39; echo in every corridor of the house. In a series of events, riots break out in the city of Varanasi, Mustafa&amp;#39;s mum begs and pleads the Pandit and his family to take back the little boy as he is much safer with them. However the doors of the house are closed for the little boy. What follows next can only be only described as a journey as Pandit Chaturvedi defies what he has believed his entire life if &amp;#39;religion&amp;#39; and listens to his inner conscience in the rousing finale.","country":"India","language":"Hindi","imdbid":"tt1047459"},"mgname":["International Films","International Dramas","Indian Films","Bollywood Films","Dramas","Musicals"],"Genreid":["78367","852493","10463","5480","5763","13335"],"people":[{"actor":["Pankaj Kapur","Suruchi Aulakh","K.K.

The best undercover identity is oneself with the volume turned up and restraint unplugged. The intensity of the case pushes Crockett and Tubbs out onto the edge where identity and fabrication become blurred, where cop and player become one - especially for Crockett in his romance with Isabella and for Tubbs in the provocation of an assault on those he loves.","country":"USA","language":"English, Spanish","imdbid":"tt0430357"},"mgname":["Action & Adventure","Crime Action & Adventure","Action Thrillers","Crime Films"],"Genreid":["1365","9584","43048","5824"],"people":[{"actor":["Elizabeth Rodriguez","Naomie Harris","John Ortiz","Li Gong","Luis Tosar","Justin Theroux","Jamie Foxx","Ciaran Hinds","Barry Shabaka Henley","Colin Farrell","Gong Li"]},{"creator":["Michael Mann","Anthony Yerkovich"]},{"director":["Michael Mann"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2020-01-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Hindi"],"subs":["English","Hindi"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Lithuania ","ccode":"lt","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["German","English","Russian"],"cid":"357","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Portugal ","ccode":"pt","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","European Spanish","French","Portuguese"],"cid":"268","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["English","Finnish","Russian"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Spain ","ccode":"es","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","European Spanish","French","Romanian"],"cid":"270","islive":"yes"}]}}

Danny knows the odds makers-they depend on her for the inside story. And Danny knows that things are going to go nowhere for Uncle Eddie unless he can make his name with one great horse, a horse &amp;#39;you can ride into the money.&amp;#39; Danny has found such a horse. Tom Thumb, a yearling up for sale, has champion potential and she knows it. She isn&amp;#39;t fooled by Noel Ferguson, a big-time trainer who is talking Tom Thumb down. And when Moe Tully arrives in town, Danny knows it can only mean one thing-that races are going to be fixed. But there&amp;#39;s opportunity in that for her. Placing her bets before school and picking up her winnings after, she is soon able to bankroll Uncle Eddie, along with her friend Gerald, a groom at a competing stable who is ready to stake his savings on Tom Thumb. When Danny&amp;#39;s hunch proves correct and Tom Thumb turns out to be a winner, she, Uncle Eddie, and Gerald head off in style for the summer racing season.

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

Ana&iuml;s knew immediately that it was possible for Samantha to be her biological twin sister and reached out to her through Twitter &amp; Facebook. This sparked the beginning of the journey for Samantha and Ana&iuml;s.","country":"UK, France, South Korea, USA","language":"English, French, Korean","imdbid":"tt2980626"},"mgname":["Biographical Documentaries","Documentaries"],"Genreid":["3652","6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Samantha Futerman","Anais Bordier"]},{"creator":["Samantha Futerman"]},{"director":["Samantha Futerman","Ryan Miyamoto"]}],"country":[]}}

Their exceptional martial arts skills allows them to reach the highest rank within the imperial guards. After a successful attempt to kill a Japanese troop leader, the Emperor orders Ying to escort the Golden Wheel of Time from Sindu back to the capital, which is said to have the power of time travel and foresee into the future. From the correspondence between Japanese and Ming officials seized from the mission, Mr. Tu - the Chief of National Defence - reveals that he can identify the traitor by the handwritings. On the way of escorting the Golden Wheel of Time in the snow, Ying is surprisingly confronted by Sao, Yuanlong and Niehu. They inform Ying the news of the murder of Tu&amp;#39;s family with Ying as the killer. The Emperor believes that Ying killed Tu in order to conceal his identity as the traitor, and orders to have Ying and his clan killed. With the Trio sent out to catch Ying, a separate troop is sent to Taoyuan to kill the villagers. From the evidence presented to Ying, he comes to the conclusion that the traitor has to be one of the trio and also the one behind the ruthless killing. Desperate to save the Taoyuan villagers, Ying chooses to fight his way out. The intensity of the duel has shaken the earth causing an avalanche that buries the four during the heat of battle. Now in 2013, Squire Tang, funded by a mysterious financer, digs up Ying, Sao and Niehu. As he is transferring the icemen to Hong Kong for further studies, the vehicle is involved in a traffic accident which, unexpectedly, defrosts Ying. Frozen for 400 years arriving to modern day Hong Kong, Ying accidentally meets an intoxicated woman named May on Halloween evening, who later gives him shelter. With his intelligence and hard-work, Ying soon becomes more familiar with the idea of modern society with the help of the internet. While adapting to his new life, Ying and May also gradually starts to fall for each other. Ying still never forgets about the injustice that framed him. He comes across a historical record on the internet stating that he plotted a revolt which branded him with the reputation of a traitor in history. However, there is no information regarding the fate of the villagers. For Ying to correct history, he must use the Golden Wheel of Time. However, Sao and Niehu are now also reanimated at present time. They continue to take up the chase they left behind in the past, eventually leading to several showdowns around Hong Kong.","country":"China, Hong Kong","language":"Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Hindi","imdbid":"tt2557256"},"mgname":["Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","International Movies","Epics","International Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Chinese Films","International Action & Adventure","Sci-Fi Adventure","Asian Movies","Martial Arts Films","Adventures","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["1492","1568","9744","78367","52858","852491","3960","852490","6926","78104","8985","7442","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Donnie Yen","Shengyi Huang","Mark Wu","Baoqiang Wang","Singh Hartihan Bitto","Suet Lam","Kang Yu","Simon Yam","Yu Kang","Wang Baoqiang","Lam Suet"]},{"creator":["Fung Lam","Mark Wu"]},{"director":["Wing-cheong Law","Law Wing-cheong"]}],"country":[]}}

As two princes on a daring mission to save their land, they must rescue the heir apparent&amp;#39;s fianc&eacute;e before their kingdom is destroyed. Thadeous (McBride) has spent his life watching his perfect older brother Fabious (Franco) embark upon valiant journeys and win the hearts of his people. Tired of being passed over for adventure, adoration and the throne, he&amp;#39;s settled for a life of wizard&amp;#39;s weed, hard booze and easy maidens. But when Fabious&amp;#39; bride-to-be, Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), gets kidnapped by the evil wizard Leezar (Justin Theroux), the king gives his deadbeat son an ultimatum: Man up and help rescue her or get cut off. Half-assedly embarking upon his first quest, Thadeous joins Fabious to trek across the perilous outlands and free the princess. Joined by Isabel (Natalie Portman)-an elusive warrior with a dangerous agenda of her own-the brothers must vanquish horrific creatures and traitorous knights before they can reach Belladonna. If Thadeous can find his inner hero, he can help his brother prevent the destruction of his land. Stay a slacker, and not only does he die a coward, he gets front row seats to the dawn of an all-new Dark Ages.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1240982"},"mgname":["Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Comedies","Action & Adventure","Action Comedies","Fantasy","Action Comedies","Spoofs & Satires","Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy"],"Genreid":["1492","6548","1365","43040","9744","43040","4922","1568","1568"],"people":[{"actor":["Natalie Portman","Toby Jones","James Franco","Rasmus Hardiker","Justin Theroux","Zooey Deschanel","Damian Lewis","Charles Shaughnessy","Charles Dance","Danny McBride","Simon Farnaby"]},{"creator":["Danny McBride","Ben Best"]},{"director":["David Gordon Green"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-02","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["English","French"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"}]}}

The Toad dispatches his two hapless hench-rats, Spike and Whitey, to get the job done. When they fail, the Toad has no choice but to send to France for his cousin - that dreaded mercenary, Le Frog.","country":"UK, USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0424095"},"mgname":["Animal Tales","Family Comedies","Family Adventures","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Films for ages 5 to 7"],"Genreid":["5507","52847","52855","783","561","5455"],"people":[{"actor":["Ian McKellen","Jean Reno","David Suchet","Bill Nighy","Shane Richie","Andy Serkis","Hugh Jackman","Kathy Burke","Kate Winslet"]},{"creator":["Sam Fell"]},{"director":["Sam Fell","David Bowers"]}],"country":[]}}

Using cybernetic implants, the Agency uses a process called &amp;#39;conditioning&amp;#39; to turn orphaned children into emotionless killing machines with hardly any memories, no human comfort and worst of all, no free will. The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta&amp;#39;s handler doesn&amp;#39;t like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life. Because if they don&amp;#39;t play by the agency&amp;#39;s rules...they will die.","country":"Japan","language":"Japanese, English","imdbid":"tt0476042"},"mgname":["Anime Series","TV Shows"],"Genreid":["6721","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Luci Christian","Alese Johnson","Kanako Mitsuhashi","Eriko Hirata","Kana Hanazawa","Atsuko Enomoto","Masashi Ebara","Norihiro Inoe","Monica Rial","Anri Shiono","Rie Nakagawa","Daisuke Kishio","Yuka Nanri","Eri Sendai","Hidenobu Kiuchi","Kana Akutsu","Ami Koshimizu","Hiroki Yasumoto","Masami Iwasaki","Mike McFarland","Norihiro Inoue","Jerry Jewell","Caitlin Glass","Hitomi Terakado","Laura Bailey","Mitsuru Miyamoto","Stephanie Young","Risa Mizuno","John Burgmeier","Kazuki Yao","Yuji Ueda","Hiroshi Yanaka","Takehito Koyasu","Masaya Matsukaze","Kozo Mito","Yuuka Nanri","Kenyu Horiuchi"]},{"creator":["Yu Aida"]},{"director":[]}],"country":[]}}

Waters and his elite squadron of tactical specialists are forced to choose between their duty and their humanity, between following orders by ignoring the conflict that surrounds them, or finding the courage to follow their conscience and protect a group of innocent refugees. When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0314353"},"mgname":["Dramas","Military Dramas","Action Thrillers","Military Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5763","11","43048","2125","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Bruce Willis","Johnny Messner","Chad Smith","Eamonn Walker","Tom Skerritt","Charles Ingram","Malick Bowens","Monica Bellucci","Cole Hauser","Nick Chinlund","Paul Francis","Awaovieyi Agie"]},{"creator":["Alex Lasker","Patrick Cirillo"]},{"director":["Antoine Fuqua"]}],"country":[{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"}]}}
