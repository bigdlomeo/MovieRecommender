He is told that he will be released if he cooperates with the authorities in identifying the person who actually sold him the hash. Billy&amp;#39;s troubles really begin when after that assistance, he makes a run for it and is recaptured. He is initially sentenced to just over four years for possession, with no time for the more harsh crime of smuggling. The prison environment is inhospitable in every sense, with a sadistic prison guard named Hamidou ruling the prison, he who relishes the mental and physical torture he inflicts on the prisoners for whatever reason. Told to trust no one, Billy does befriend a few of the other inmates, namely fellow American Jimmy Booth (in for stealing two candlesticks from a mosque), a Swede named Erich, and one of the senior prisoners having already served seven years, an Englishman named Max, the latter two also in for hash related charges. One prisoner not befriended is Rifki, who wields power in the prison as the unofficial eyes and ears for the guards. As Billy, his family and his girlfriend Susan attempt through legal and diplomatic channels for Billy&amp;#39;s release, Max tells him that the only way out is to &amp;#39;catch the midnight express&amp;#39; aka escape, which is what Jimmy is continually trying to do.

The snake slithers into the front of the truck, kills the driver with its bite and then moves off into the forest. Flash forward to 1999. The small southern California town of San Vicente has grown from 6,000 to 30,000, and the rattler, which escaped nearby years ago, has bred. There are now 25,000 of these hybrid rattlesnakes, and they are slowly making their way downhill into the town, attracted by the movement of the blasting as the town paves its way toward progress. Progress, in this case, brings terror, in this tale originally penned by John Carpenter.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0203139"},"mgname":["US Movies","Horror Movies","Thrillers"],"Genreid":["1159493","8711","8933"],"people":[{"actor":["David Spielberg","Patty McCormack","Beau Billingslea","Jack Scalia","Harry Hamlin","Phillip Troy Linger","David Webb","Shannon Sturges","Carolyn Bock","David Whitney","Dominic Purcell"]},{"creator":["John Carpenter","William S.

Curt, who received a lucrative local scholarship, is seen as the promise that their class holds. But Curt is having second thoughts about leaving what Steve basically sees as their dead end town. Curt&amp;#39;s beliefs are strengthened when he spots an unknown beautiful blonde in a T-bird who mouths the words &amp;#39;I love you&amp;#39; to him. As Curt tries to find that blonde while trying to get away from a local gang who have him somewhat hostage, Curt may come to a decision about his immediate future. Outgoing class president Steve, on the other hand, wants to leave, despite meaning that he will leave girlfriend, head cheerleader and Curt&amp;#39;s sister, Laurie Henderson, behind. Steve and Laurie spend the evening &amp;#39;negotiating&amp;#39; the state of their relationship. Meanwhile, two of their friends cruise around town for the evening.

The wheels give Toad a new sense of confidence, which he uses to try and impress Debbie Dunham, a more experienced girl generally out of his league. And John Milner, who is seen as the king of the street race in his souped-up yellow deuce coupe, tries to get rid of precocious pre-teen, Carol Morrison, who has somehow become his passenger for the evening, while dealing with the challenge of bold out-of-towner, Bob Falfa.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0069704"},"mgname":["Critically-acclaimed Dramas","Dramas","Comedies","Classic Films","Critically-acclaimed Comedies","20th Century Period Pieces","Critically-acclaimed Films","Golden Globe Award-winning Films"],"Genreid":["6206","5763","6548","31574","9736","12739","3979","82489"],"people":[{"actor":["Harrison Ford","Candy Clark","Richard Dreyfuss","Beau Gentry","Bo Hopkins","Charles Martin Smith","Paul Le Mat","Manuel Padilla Jr.","Jim Bohan","Deby Celiz","Mackenzie Phillips","Suzanne Somers","Wolfman Jack","Jana Bellan","Ron Howard","Cindy Williams"]},{"creator":["George Lucas","Gloria Katz","Willard Huyck"]},{"director":["George Lucas"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2020-01-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"}]}}

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

Travers&amp;#39; Mary Poppins (1964), he made them a promise - one that he didn&amp;#39;t realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney&amp;#39;s plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn&amp;#39;t budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.","country":"USA, UK, Australia","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2140373"},"mgname":["Dramas","Biographical Dramas","Comedies","Dramas based on real life"],"Genreid":["5763","3179","6548","3653"],"people":[{"actor":["Emma Thompson","Tom Hanks","Annie Rose Buckley","Colin Farrell","B.J.

At the center of it all is the rise, fall and redemption of Freeway Rick Ross, a street hustler who became the King of Crack, and journalist Gary Webb, who broke the story of the CIA&amp;#39;s complicity in the drug war. Featuring exclusive interviews with Freeway Rick Ross, not to be confused with the rapper who took his name Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb, his source Coral Baca, and wife Susan Webb former Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff Roberto Juarez drug trafficker Julio Zavala and many more. The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection.

Woods is then replaced by former boxer Sam Simms, who won a boxing title in 1977. Sam is eager to take the job - even though no one else wants it. Everyone thinks that Luke is just a brat when the only thing Luke wants is to just fit in and be like every other kid at his school, the Georgetown Academy. Sam almost gets fired when Luke gets decked at school by school bully Rob MacArthur. This is when Sam decides to use his boxing expertise to teach Luke how to fight. Luke has his eyes on class-mate Katie Warren, but so does Rob. Katie agrees to go with Luke to an upcoming school dance, so Sam teaches Luke how to dance. Rob is also at the dance, but this time when Rob tries to deck Luke, Luke turns the tables and decks Rob. Sam is then fired for taking Luke to the dance without permission, although Luke had the permission of his parents, but secret service chief Morton didn&amp;#39;t want Luke leaving the White House grounds while Luke&amp;#39;s parents were on the campaign trail. Luke runs away anyway to meet a friend that he has been chatting on the internet with. The meeting is set to take place at a local mall where Luke discovers that his secret friend is a now psychotic Woods, who blames Luke for his firing and wants revenge on Luke, but not if Sam can help it.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0116311"},"mgname":["Family Features","Family Comedies","Children & Family Films","Comedies","Films for ages 11 to 12"],"Genreid":["51056","52847","783","6548","6962"],"people":[{"actor":["Sinbad","Brock Pierce","Blake Boyd","Lisa Eichhorn","Zachery Ty Bryan","Erin Williby","Fawn Reed","Art LaFleur","Michael Krawic","Jemar Jefferson","Timothy Busfield","James Naughton","Bill Cobbs","Robert Guillaume"]},{"creator":["Tim Kelleher"]},{"director":["David Mickey Evans","David M.

From the producers of LUCY and the TAKEN trilogy, THE TRANSPORTER REFUELED is a fresh personification of the iconic role of Frank Martin, that launches the high-octane franchise into the present-day and introduces it to the next generation of thrill-seekers.","country":"France, China, Belgium, Monaco","language":"English, Russian, French","imdbid":"tt2938956"},"mgname":["International Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure","Action Thrillers","Crime Action & Adventure","International Movies","French Movies"],"Genreid":["852490","1365","43048","9584","78367","58807"],"people":[{"actor":["Yuri Kolokolnikov","Anatole Taubman","Ray Stevenson","Gabriella Wright","Lenn Kudrjawizki","Ed Skrein","Radivoje Bukvic","Samir Guesmi","Tatiana Pajkovic","Loan Chabanol","Wenxia Yu","No&eacute;mie Lenoir"]},{"creator":["Adam Cooper","Bill Collage","Luc Besson","Robert Mark Kamen"]},{"director":["Camille Delamarre"]}],"country":[{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Greek","English"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-02","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Polish"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2019-01-08","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"}]}}

The Thracians had been persuaded by Claudius Glaber to serve as auxiliaries in the Roman legions in a campaign against the Getae, who had often plundered Thracian lands. However after Glaber reneges on the deal and switches his attentions from the Getae to attack Mithridates in Asia Minor, the Thracians feel betrayed and mutiny. Captured by Glaber, Spartacus is condemned to death as a Gladiator, whilst his wife Sura is condemned to slavery. Spartacus, however, proves to be a formidable gladiator, and defeats the four gladiators tasked with executing him. He becomes a favorite of the crowd, leading Senator Albinius to commute his death sentence to a life of slavery. Spartacus is purchased by Batiatus for gladiator training, who promises to help him find Sura if he proves himself in training. As the series develops, the story follows the betrayals and machinations of Roman life and a tale of one man&amp;#39;s heroic quest for vengeance.","country":"USA","language":"English, German","imdbid":"tt1442449"},"mgname":["TV Action & Adventure","US TV Programmes","TV Dramas","TV Programmes"],"Genreid":["10673","72404","11714","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Daniel Feuerriegel","Peter Mensah","Andy Whitfield","Liam McIntyre","Dustin Clare","Viva Bianca","Jai Courtney","John Hannah","Manu Bennett","Nick E.

But the early days are tough, seasickness being soon replaced by loneliness and homesickness, two feelings all the more acutely felt by Eilis for having had to leave behind her widowed mother and her dear sister Rose. She nevertheless little by little manages to find her footing by adapting to her job as a salesgirl, by studying bookkeeping at Brooklyn College as well as with a little help from both Father Flood and Mrs. Kehoe, the owner of the boarding school she now lives in. And not only does graduation follow but love shows its face in Tony, an Italian-American plumber, full of adoration and respect for her. They end up marrying, although keeping the thing secret. It is at that point that tragedy strikes inciting Eilis to return to Enniscorthy to support her mother morally. And there a strange thing happens : she gradually gets lured by the charms of her native place, going far as to let herself be wooed by Jim Farrell, a young local.","country":"UK, Canada, Ireland","language":"English, Latin, Irish","imdbid":"tt2381111"},"mgname":["Romantic Favourites","British Dramas","Dramas based on a book","20th Century Period Pieces","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Dramas","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["502675","3682","4961","12739","1255","10757","5763","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Jenn Murray","Fiona Glascott","Jim Broadbent","Michael Zegen","Jane Brennan","Julie Walters","Emory Cohen","Eva Birthistle","Brid Brennan","Saoirse Ronan","Eve Macklin","Jessica Pare","Domhnall Gleeson","Nora-Jane Noone","Hugh Gormley","Maeve McGrath"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Colm Toibin"]},{"director":["John Crowley"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Australia ","ccode":"au","seasons":"","new":"2018-12-08","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","Greek","English","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"23","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-25","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["Greek","English"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"}]}}

Their exceptional martial arts skills allows them to reach the highest rank within the imperial guards. After a successful attempt to kill a Japanese troop leader, the Emperor orders Ying to escort the Golden Wheel of Time from Sindu back to the capital, which is said to have the power of time travel and foresee into the future. From the correspondence between Japanese and Ming officials seized from the mission, Mr. Tu - the Chief of National Defence - reveals that he can identify the traitor by the handwritings. On the way of escorting the Golden Wheel of Time in the snow, Ying is surprisingly confronted by Sao, Yuanlong and Niehu. They inform Ying the news of the murder of Tu&amp;#39;s family with Ying as the killer. The Emperor believes that Ying killed Tu in order to conceal his identity as the traitor, and orders to have Ying and his clan killed. With the Trio sent out to catch Ying, a separate troop is sent to Taoyuan to kill the villagers. From the evidence presented to Ying, he comes to the conclusion that the traitor has to be one of the trio and also the one behind the ruthless killing. Desperate to save the Taoyuan villagers, Ying chooses to fight his way out. The intensity of the duel has shaken the earth causing an avalanche that buries the four during the heat of battle. Now in 2013, Squire Tang, funded by a mysterious financer, digs up Ying, Sao and Niehu. As he is transferring the icemen to Hong Kong for further studies, the vehicle is involved in a traffic accident which, unexpectedly, defrosts Ying. Frozen for 400 years arriving to modern day Hong Kong, Ying accidentally meets an intoxicated woman named May on Halloween evening, who later gives him shelter. With his intelligence and hard-work, Ying soon becomes more familiar with the idea of modern society with the help of the internet. While adapting to his new life, Ying and May also gradually starts to fall for each other. Ying still never forgets about the injustice that framed him. He comes across a historical record on the internet stating that he plotted a revolt which branded him with the reputation of a traitor in history. However, there is no information regarding the fate of the villagers. For Ying to correct history, he must use the Golden Wheel of Time. However, Sao and Niehu are now also reanimated at present time. They continue to take up the chase they left behind in the past, eventually leading to several showdowns around Hong Kong.","country":"China, Hong Kong","language":"Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Hindi","imdbid":"tt2557256"},"mgname":["Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","International Movies","Epics","International Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Chinese Films","International Action & Adventure","Sci-Fi Adventure","Asian Movies","Martial Arts Films","Adventures","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["1492","1568","9744","78367","52858","852491","3960","852490","6926","78104","8985","7442","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Donnie Yen","Shengyi Huang","Mark Wu","Baoqiang Wang","Singh Hartihan Bitto","Suet Lam","Kang Yu","Simon Yam","Yu Kang","Wang Baoqiang","Lam Suet"]},{"creator":["Fung Lam","Mark Wu"]},{"director":["Wing-cheong Law","Law Wing-cheong"]}],"country":[]}}

A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens.

Danny (Jack Roth), an ordinary working class kid, is angry and frustrated at the rough deal he faces. When he confronts Conrad (Tim Bentinck) a member of today&amp;#39;s privileged elite, he aims to teach him and his kind a lesson they will never forget. Holding Conrad and his family hostage in their plush mansion, Danny and his pals force Conrad into a deadly game of chance. Danny&amp;#39;s master plan is to kick-start a revolution by streaming attacks against the super-rich one percent on the web. His ultimate goal? To terrify the elite into bringing about change. Danny&amp;#39;s cohorts, however, have other ideas - and in a confusing cocktail of terror, deceit and twisting narrative, we are left wondering which side people are on - and everyone&amp;#39;s values are questioned.

But, to his happy amazement, his novel, which was to become &amp;#39;Look Homeward, Angel,&amp;#39; was accepted for publication. The only trouble was that it was overlong (by 300 pages) and had to be reduced. Although reluctant to see his poetic prose trimmed, Wolfe agreed and was helped by Perkins, who had become a true friend, with the result that it instantly became a favorite with the critics and a best seller. Success was even greater in 1935 when &amp;#39;Of Time and the River&amp;#39; appeared, but the fight for reducing Wolfe&amp;#39;s logorrheic written expression had been even harder, with the novel originally at 5,000 pages.

If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0314353"},"mgname":["Dramas","Military Dramas","Action Thrillers","Military Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5763","11","43048","2125","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Bruce Willis","Johnny Messner","Chad Smith","Eamonn Walker","Tom Skerritt","Charles Ingram","Malick Bowens","Monica Bellucci","Cole Hauser","Nick Chinlund","Paul Francis","Awaovieyi Agie"]},{"creator":["Alex Lasker","Patrick Cirillo"]},{"director":["Antoine Fuqua"]}],"country":[{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"}]}}

Using cybernetic implants, the Agency uses a process called &amp;#39;conditioning&amp;#39; to turn orphaned children into emotionless killing machines with hardly any memories, no human comfort and worst of all, no free will. The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta&amp;#39;s handler doesn&amp;#39;t like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life. Because if they don&amp;#39;t play by the agency&amp;#39;s rules...they will die.","country":"Japan","language":"Japanese, English","imdbid":"tt0476042"},"mgname":["Anime Series","TV Shows"],"Genreid":["6721","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Luci Christian","Alese Johnson","Kanako Mitsuhashi","Eriko Hirata","Kana Hanazawa","Atsuko Enomoto","Masashi Ebara","Norihiro Inoe","Monica Rial","Anri Shiono","Rie Nakagawa","Daisuke Kishio","Yuka Nanri","Eri Sendai","Hidenobu Kiuchi","Kana Akutsu","Ami Koshimizu","Hiroki Yasumoto","Masami Iwasaki","Mike McFarland","Norihiro Inoue","Jerry Jewell","Caitlin Glass","Hitomi Terakado","Laura Bailey","Mitsuru Miyamoto","Stephanie Young","Risa Mizuno","John Burgmeier","Kazuki Yao","Yuji Ueda","Hiroshi Yanaka","Takehito Koyasu","Masaya Matsukaze","Kozo Mito","Yuuka Nanri","Kenyu Horiuchi"]},{"creator":["Yu Aida"]},{"director":[]}],"country":[]}}

Born in 1950, Beverly grew up bright and ambitious in a working-class neighborhood in Connecticut; her father was a tough but good-hearted cop who listened to his daughter&amp;#39;s problems, and her mother was a nervous woman eager to imagine the worst. From an early age, Beverly displays a keen intelligence and an interest in literature, and dreams of going to college in New York and becoming a writer. However, she also develops an early interest in boys, and at 15 finds herself madly in love with a boy from her high school. However, an attempt to get his attention leads to an embarassing incident at a party, and Ray, a sweet but thick-headed 18-year-old, steps forward to defend her. Beverly and Ray end up making out, and after one thing leads to another, Beverly discovers she&amp;#39;s pregnant. Telling Ray is only marginally less difficult than informing her parents, and at 16, Beverly is a wife and mother. Against the odds, Beverly is determined to still finish high school and go on to college, but that goal becomes more difficult with time, especially after Beverly&amp;#39;s marriage begins to fall apart. Ray tries to do the right thing but has trouble holding a job, and becomes addicted to heroin.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0200027"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Biographical Dramas","Dramas based on real life","Dramas based on contemporary literature"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","3179","3653","12994"],"people":[{"actor":["Drew Barrymore","Steve Zahn","Brittany Murphy","Adam Garcia","Lorraine Bracco","James Woods","Sara Gilbert","Rosie Perez","Mika Boorem","Peter Facinelli","David Moscow","Desmond Harrington","Skye McCole Bartusiak","Maggie Gyllenhaal","Vincent Pastore"]},{"creator":["Beverly D&amp;#39;Onofrio","Morgan Ward"]},{"director":["Penny Marshall"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-01-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["French"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Iceland ","ccode":"is","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-05","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Danish","English"],"cid":"265","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-13","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","Greek","English","French","Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-19","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Italian","Portuguese"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"}]}}

Soon Jonah embarks on an adventure that leads him into the belly of a whale, and to the heart of Nineveh for a hilarious showdown.","country":"USA, UK","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0298388"},"mgname":["Faith & Spirituality","Kids Music","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Musicals","Kids Faith & Spirituality","Films for ages 5 to 7"],"Genreid":["26835","52843","783","561","13335","751423","5455"],"people":[{"actor":["Phil Vischer","Mike Nawrocki","Lisa Vischer","Tim Hodge","Dan Anderson","Jim Poole","Shelby Vischer","Kristin Blegen","Ron Smith"]},{"creator":["Mike Nawrocki","Tim Hodge"]},{"director":["Mike Nawrocki","Phil Vischer"]}],"country":[]}}

The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta&amp;#39;s handler doesn&amp;#39;t like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life.

At the center of it all is the rise, fall and redemption of Freeway Rick Ross, a street hustler who became the King of Crack, and journalist Gary Webb, who broke the story of the CIA&amp;#39;s complicity in the drug war. Featuring exclusive interviews with Freeway Rick Ross, not to be confused with the rapper who took his name Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb, his source Coral Baca, and wife Susan Webb former Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff Roberto Juarez drug trafficker Julio Zavala and many more. The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation.

Participants are flown to Los Angeles first class, paid $1,500, and put up for four nights in a luxury hotel. Suitable participants are deemed to be younger, muscular males. The event is held on a monthly basis. In contacting the organizers, US-based Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media, via their popular Facebook to arrange for an interview, David receives a return message from one of their representatives, Debbie J. Kuhn, declining the offer, the message a homophobic rant largely against David. In that message, Debbie asserts that the competition is wholly a heterosexual athletic activity, she who does not appreciate what will be David&amp;#39;s assumed gay bent on the story as a homosexual himself (which David does not state he is or isn&amp;#39;t in his request). David finds the message all the more odd as the activity as it appears in the videos has an undeniable gay vibe. What is even more odd is that Debbie on behalf of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien, continually emails David over the following weeks expounding on the themes in the original message. At this time, David&amp;#39;s friend, Dylan Reeve, enters the fray, acting initially as a researcher for David, and then eventually as co-filmmaker for a documentary on the subject. However, the documentary eventually morphs from the sport of competitive endurance tickling into the mysterious world of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien and Debbie Kuhn, especially: as they seem to have unlimited resources both to hold the events and to conduct their online harassment they learn not only of David, but of former associates who now seem to want to distance themselves from the &amp;#39;sport&amp;#39; and Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media; as Jane and Debbie initiate legal action and threaten even more legal action, and issue general threats time and time against David and Dylan not only for this unauthorized documentary but for their activities toward Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media as a whole; and as no one seems to know who Debbie or Jane are, even the people that work for them, or what their end goal is. The story takes a further twist when David and Dylan learn there truly is a tickling sexual fetish subculture, one within that community, Richard Ivey, who willingly talks to David and who remembers someone else online decades ago within the community with a similar M.O. to Debbie and Jane.","country":"New Zealand","language":"English","imdbid":"tt5278506"},"mgname":["Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Dylan Reeve","David Farrier","David Starr","Hal Karp"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["David Farrier","Dylan Reeve"]}],"country":[]}}

In 1853, the US fleet commanded by Admiral Perry forced the doors open, leading to a modernization of the nation&amp;#39;s sociopolitical systems and the eventual fall of the Shogunate. The samurai regime ended its life with the imperial restoration in 1868. That&amp;#39;s what history tells, but in Gintama, that&amp;#39;s not what happens. Instead of the US fleet, the country is stormed by spaceships coming from four corners of the universe and soon we see it occupied by extraterrestrials. The Shogunate has become a puppet of alien occupation armies. All samurais have been disarmed and reduced to temp workers with no skills who just try to make ends meet. Gintama is a story of a handyman named Gintoki, a samurai with no respect for rules set by the invaders, who&amp;#39;s ready to take any job to survive. He and his gang, however, are also among the very few who have not forgotten the morale of a swordsman. Wherever they go, all they do is to create troubles.

Using cybernetic implants, the Agency uses a process called &amp;#39;conditioning&amp;#39; to turn orphaned children into emotionless killing machines with hardly any memories, no human comfort and worst of all, no free will. The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta&amp;#39;s handler doesn&amp;#39;t like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life. Because if they don&amp;#39;t play by the agency&amp;#39;s rules...they will die.","country":"Japan","language":"Japanese, English","imdbid":"tt0476042"},"mgname":["Anime Series","TV Shows"],"Genreid":["6721","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Luci Christian","Alese Johnson","Kanako Mitsuhashi","Eriko Hirata","Kana Hanazawa","Atsuko Enomoto","Masashi Ebara","Norihiro Inoe","Monica Rial","Anri Shiono","Rie Nakagawa","Daisuke Kishio","Yuka Nanri","Eri Sendai","Hidenobu Kiuchi","Kana Akutsu","Ami Koshimizu","Hiroki Yasumoto","Masami Iwasaki","Mike McFarland","Norihiro Inoue","Jerry Jewell","Caitlin Glass","Hitomi Terakado","Laura Bailey","Mitsuru Miyamoto","Stephanie Young","Risa Mizuno","John Burgmeier","Kazuki Yao","Yuji Ueda","Hiroshi Yanaka","Takehito Koyasu","Masaya Matsukaze","Kozo Mito","Yuuka Nanri","Kenyu Horiuchi"]},{"creator":["Yu Aida"]},{"director":[]}],"country":[]}}

The grandson is sure he won&amp;#39;t like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and &amp;#39;no kissing&amp;#39;. But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of &amp;#39;as you wish&amp;#39; to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0093779"},"mgname":["Family Features","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Cult Comedies","Fantasy","Romantic Favourites","Family Comedies","Romantic Comedies","Cult Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Family Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Comedies","Adventures","Action & Adventure","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["51056","1492","9434","9744","502675","52847","5475","4734","52849","783","561","6548","7442","1365","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Cary Elwes","Peter Cook","Peter Falk","Christopher Guest","Andre the Giant","Mandy Patinkin","Wallace Shawn","Fred Savage","Robin Wright","Chris Sarandon","Billy Crystal"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Rob Reiner"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"}]}}

When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs.

Danny knows the odds makers-they depend on her for the inside story. And Danny knows that things are going to go nowhere for Uncle Eddie unless he can make his name with one great horse, a horse &amp;#39;you can ride into the money.&amp;#39; Danny has found such a horse. Tom Thumb, a yearling up for sale, has champion potential and she knows it. She isn&amp;#39;t fooled by Noel Ferguson, a big-time trainer who is talking Tom Thumb down. And when Moe Tully arrives in town, Danny knows it can only mean one thing-that races are going to be fixed. But there&amp;#39;s opportunity in that for her. Placing her bets before school and picking up her winnings after, she is soon able to bankroll Uncle Eddie, along with her friend Gerald, a groom at a competing stable who is ready to stake his savings on Tom Thumb. When Danny&amp;#39;s hunch proves correct and Tom Thumb turns out to be a winner, she, Uncle Eddie, and Gerald head off in style for the summer racing season.

Preferring to test the odds alone, career gambler Dylan Johns ignores captain&amp;#39;s orders to wait below for possible rescue and sets out to find his own way to safety. What begins as a solo mission soon draws others, as Dylan is followed by a desperate father searching for his daughter and her fianc&eacute;e--a young couple who hours before couldn&amp;#39;t summon the courage to tell him they were engaged and now face much graver challenges. Along the way they are joined by a single mother and her wise-beyond-his-years son, an anxious stowaway and a despondent fellow passenger who boarded the ship not sure he wanted to live but now knows he doesn&amp;#39;t want to die. Determined to fight their way to the surface, the group sets off through the disorienting maze of twisted steel in the upside-down wreckage. As the unstable vessel rapidly fills with water each must draw on skills and strengths they didn&amp;#39;t even know they possessed, fighting against time for their own survival and for each other.","country":"USA","language":"English, Spanish","imdbid":"tt0409182"},"mgname":["Action Thrillers","Action & Adventure","Adventures"],"Genreid":["43048","1365","7442"],"people":[{"actor":["Josh Lucas","Kevin Dillon","Mia Maestro","Freddy Rodriguez","Richard Dreyfuss","Mike Vogel","Emmy Rossum","Jacinda Barrett","Kurt Russell"]},{"creator":["Mark Protosevich","Paul Gallico"]},{"director":["Wolfgang Petersen"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2019-04-05","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2019-04-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Hindi"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Lithuania ","ccode":"lt","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"357","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2019-04-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

The journals are found by her children after the lawyer was going over Francesca&amp;#39;s will and all the contents which produces a key to her hope chest in the bedroom which contained some of hers and Robert&amp;#39;s things. The message they take from the diaries is to what you what you have to do to be happy in life. After learning that Robert Kincaid&amp;#39;s cremated remains were scattered off Roseman Bridge and that their mother requested that she too be cremated and her ashes to be scattered off Roseman Bridge, the children must decide whether to honor their mother&amp;#39;s final wishes or bury her alongside their father as the family had planned.

No longer is sex, weight, height and orientation a factor. This now allows for an insurgence of people applying. The Police Academy series follows a select group of misfits in their quest to become police men and women. The first film of the series follows these misfits in their time at the Police Academy. The main focus is on a petty criminal called Mahoney. Mahoney is busted for criminal damage and as punishment is forced to go to Police Academy. Mahoney initially feels that this isn&amp;#39;t the right place for him and he makes it his mission to be thrown out as he is not allowed to quit. As the classes go by and the training exercises are played out, Mahoney soon realizes that he is actually enjoying the academy and does want to become a police officer. We are also introduced to the gun maniac Tackelberry, the very tall Hightower, voluptuous Callahan, squeaky Hooks, human beat box and sound effects master Jones and the ever confuzzled Commandant Lassard. This group become good friends and become the base for the rest of the series of films.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0087928"},"mgname":["Crime Films","Slapstick Comedies","Action Comedies","Comedies","Late Night Comedies","Crime Comedies","Action & Adventure","Police Detective Movies","Crime Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5824","10256","43040","6548","1402","4058","1365","79049","9584"],"people":[{"actor":["Kim Cattrall","G.W.

Now, former CIA assassin Mitch Leary is stalking the current President, who is running for re-election. Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan, telling him of his plans to kill the President. Leary plans to kill the president because Leary feels betrayed by the government -- Leary was removed from the CIA, and the CIA is now trying to have him killed. After talking to Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty, working with fellow secret service agent Lilly Raines. Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around, and he&amp;#39;s more than willing to take a bullet. White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent refuses to alter the President&amp;#39;s itinerary, while Horrigan&amp;#39;s boss, Secret Service Director Sam Campagna, is supportive of Horrigan. As the election gets closer, Horrigan begins to doubt his own abilities, especially when Horrigan&amp;#39;s colleague Al D&amp;#39;Andrea is killed by Leary. But Horrigan may be the only one who can stop Leary.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0107206"},"mgname":["Spy Action & Adventure","Police Action & Adventure","Action Thrillers","Action & Adventure","Crime Action & Adventure","Police Movies","Spy Action & Adventure","Police Action & Adventure","Action Thrillers","Action & Adventure","Crime Action & Adventure","Police Movies"],"Genreid":["10702","75418","43048","1365","9584","75436","10702","75418","43048","1365","9584","75436"],"people":[{"actor":["Rene Russo","John Malkovich","Clint Eastwood","Bob Schott","John Mahoney","Dylan McDermott","Sally Hughes","Tobin Bell","John Heard","Jim Curley","Gary Cole","Fred Dalton Thompson","Gregory Alan Williams"]},{"creator":["Jeff Maguire"]},{"director":["Wolfgang Petersen"]}],"country":[{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["English","French"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","French","Russian","Turkish"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"}]}}

A man who lives for his religion, soaked in years of ancient traditions, values and morals. He is a strict, yet lovable man. As any real priest would, Chaturvedi believes he is a disciple of God on this earth to spread God&amp;#39;s message and love as he goes about his rigidly ritualistic world of pooja&amp;#39;s and teachings. One day his daughter brings home an infant (Krish Parekh) and the mother of the infant has disappeared and cannot be found nowhere. Pandit Chaturvedi is hesitant to have the child around the house at first, and when it&amp;#39;s confirmed that the child has been abandoned, he then makes the decision that the child will be raised in the local orphanage. However the Pandit&amp;#39;s wife Parvati (Supriya Pathak Kapur) has by now developed a soft spot for the young child and requests her husband if they can keep and raise the child if as their own. Hesitant at first, the priest reluctantly agrees as his wife lies to him that the baby is the son of a Brahmin. Slowly, the child wins over everyone hearts in the house including Pandit Chaturvedi who finds a son, a disciple and a best friend in the child. The story takes a turn when the baby&amp;#39;s mother returns to claim him back, and much to the shock of Pandit Chaturvedi, the lady is a Muslim. The child who they&amp;#39;d fondly named Karthik is in fact Mustafa. Pandit Chaturvedi is in a state of shock and utter despair as he feels he has done the biggest sin of his life and feel as if he has betrayed his religion and more-so God. In a state of recluse and regret, Pandit Chaturvedi decides to take a series of different vows and &amp;#39;vraths&amp;#39; to clear his conscience. However whilst his mind is telling him he has done a grave sin, his heart sorely misses his little son, and the words &amp;#39;babuji&amp;#39; echo in every corridor of the house. In a series of events, riots break out in the city of Varanasi, Mustafa&amp;#39;s mum begs and pleads the Pandit and his family to take back the little boy as he is much safer with them. However the doors of the house are closed for the little boy.

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin.

At first glance their life seems idyllic; they call each other &amp;#39;Mother&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Father&amp;#39; and seem to dote on the kids. But Kelly was a garage-band crooner whose voice was ruined in an auto accident. He&amp;#39;s resigned to a dead-end factory job that barely pays the bills, and is given to fits of alcohol-induced rage. Evelyn, a stay-at-home wife and mother, deals with this abuse by appealing to her priest, who is no help at all. She deals with their poverty by entering the jingle contests that were the rage in the 50&amp;#39;s and early 60&amp;#39;s, even sending in multiple entries in the names of the children. She is very clever at it, winning more than her share of prizes, but her successes aren&amp;#39;t enough to keep the wolf from the door. Further, they trigger Kelly&amp;#39;s insecurities and he retreats deeper into the bottle, using food and mortgage money to support the habit. Can the loving, optimistic Evelyn hold the family together? Is she justified in placing her faith in the deeply-flawed Kelly? How will the children turn out? This underrated film provides an inspirational answer to these questions.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0406158"},"mgname":["Independent Dramas","Dramas","20th Century Period Pieces","Independent Films","Dramas based on a book","Dramas based on real life","Dramas based on contemporary literature"],"Genreid":["384","5763","12739","7077","4961","3653","12994"],"people":[{"actor":["Julianne Moore","Woody Harrelson","Laura Dern","Trevor Morgan","Erik Knudsen","Jordan Todosey","Colin Ford","Ellary Porterfield","Frank Chiesurin","Simon Reynolds","Melanie Tonello"]},{"creator":["Terry Ryan","Jane Anderson"]},{"director":["Jane Anderson"]}],"country":[]}}

The Thracians had been persuaded by Claudius Glaber to serve as auxiliaries in the Roman legions in a campaign against the Getae, who had often plundered Thracian lands. However after Glaber reneges on the deal and switches his attentions from the Getae to attack Mithridates in Asia Minor, the Thracians feel betrayed and mutiny. Captured by Glaber, Spartacus is condemned to death as a Gladiator, whilst his wife Sura is condemned to slavery. Spartacus, however, proves to be a formidable gladiator, and defeats the four gladiators tasked with executing him. He becomes a favorite of the crowd, leading Senator Albinius to commute his death sentence to a life of slavery. Spartacus is purchased by Batiatus for gladiator training, who promises to help him find Sura if he proves himself in training. As the series develops, the story follows the betrayals and machinations of Roman life and a tale of one man&amp;#39;s heroic quest for vengeance.","country":"USA","language":"English, German","imdbid":"tt1442449"},"mgname":["TV Action & Adventure","US TV Programmes","TV Dramas","TV Programmes"],"Genreid":["10673","72404","11714","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Daniel Feuerriegel","Peter Mensah","Andy Whitfield","Liam McIntyre","Dustin Clare","Viva Bianca","Jai Courtney","John Hannah","Manu Bennett","Nick E.

However, Mumble has an astute talent for something that none of the penguins had ever seen before: tap dancing. Though Mumble&amp;#39;s mom, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, his dad, Memphis, says it &amp;#39;just ain&amp;#39;t penguin.&amp;#39; Besides, they both know that, without a Heartsong, Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange &amp;#39;hippity- hoppity&amp;#39; ways. Mumble is just too different--especially for Noah the Elder, the stern leader of Emperor Land, who ultimately casts him out of the community. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly un-Emperor-like penguins--the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon, the Adelies instantly embrace Mumble&amp;#39;s cool dance moves and invite him to party with them. In Adelie Land, Mumble seeks the counsel of Lovelace the Guru, a crazy-feathered Rockhopper penguin who will answer any of life&amp;#39;s questions for the price of a pebble. Together with Lovelace and the Amigos, Mumble sets out across vast landscapes and, after some epic encounters, proves that by being true to yourself, you can make all the difference in the world.","country":"USA, Australia","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0366548"},"mgname":["Family Features","Kids Music","Animal Tales","Family Feature Animation","Family Comedies","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Comedies","Musicals","Films for ages 5 to 7","Music & Musicals"],"Genreid":["51056","52843","5507","51058","52847","783","561","6548","13335","5455","52852"],"people":[{"actor":["Hugh Jackman","Hugo Weaving","Nicole Kidman","Robin Williams","Elizabeth Daily","Anthony LaPaglia","Elijah Wood","Brittany Murphy"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Warren Coleman","Judy Morris","George Miller"]}],"country":[{"country":"Australia ","ccode":"au","seasons":"","new":"2020-01-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"23","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-03","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Dutch"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2016-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-05","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Hebrew","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Lithuania ","ccode":"lt","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"357","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Dutch"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2018-02-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["English","Polish"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["English","Russian"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-01-10","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Dutch"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

The snake slithers into the front of the truck, kills the driver with its bite and then moves off into the forest. Flash forward to 1999. The small southern California town of San Vicente has grown from 6,000 to 30,000, and the rattler, which escaped nearby years ago, has bred. There are now 25,000 of these hybrid rattlesnakes, and they are slowly making their way downhill into the town, attracted by the movement of the blasting as the town paves its way toward progress. Progress, in this case, brings terror, in this tale originally penned by John Carpenter.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0203139"},"mgname":["US Movies","Horror Movies","Thrillers"],"Genreid":["1159493","8711","8933"],"people":[{"actor":["David Spielberg","Patty McCormack","Beau Billingslea","Jack Scalia","Harry Hamlin","Phillip Troy Linger","David Webb","Shannon Sturges","Carolyn Bock","David Whitney","Dominic Purcell"]},{"creator":["John Carpenter","William S.

Using cybernetic implants, the Agency uses a process called &amp;#39;conditioning&amp;#39; to turn orphaned children into emotionless killing machines with hardly any memories, no human comfort and worst of all, no free will. The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta&amp;#39;s handler doesn&amp;#39;t like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life. Because if they don&amp;#39;t play by the agency&amp;#39;s rules...they will die.","country":"Japan","language":"Japanese, English","imdbid":"tt0476042"},"mgname":["Anime Series","TV Shows"],"Genreid":["6721","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Luci Christian","Alese Johnson","Kanako Mitsuhashi","Eriko Hirata","Kana Hanazawa","Atsuko Enomoto","Masashi Ebara","Norihiro Inoe","Monica Rial","Anri Shiono","Rie Nakagawa","Daisuke Kishio","Yuka Nanri","Eri Sendai","Hidenobu Kiuchi","Kana Akutsu","Ami Koshimizu","Hiroki Yasumoto","Masami Iwasaki","Mike McFarland","Norihiro Inoue","Jerry Jewell","Caitlin Glass","Hitomi Terakado","Laura Bailey","Mitsuru Miyamoto","Stephanie Young","Risa Mizuno","John Burgmeier","Kazuki Yao","Yuji Ueda","Hiroshi Yanaka","Takehito Koyasu","Masaya Matsukaze","Kozo Mito","Yuuka Nanri","Kenyu Horiuchi"]},{"creator":["Yu Aida"]},{"director":[]}],"country":[]}}

Following King Richard&amp;#39;s death in France, archer Robin Longstride, along with Will Scarlett, Alan-a-Dale and Little John, returns to England. They encounter the dying Robert of Locksley, whose party was ambushed by treacherous Godfrey, who hopes to facilitate a French invasion of England. Robin promises the dying knight he will return his sword to his father Walter in Nottingham.

For over fifty years, Burma has been a war zone. The Karen people of the region, who consist of peasants and farmers, have endured brutally oppressive rule from the murderous Burmese military and have been struggling for survival every single day. After some inner contemplation, Rambo accepts the offer and takes Michael, Sarah, and the rest of the missionaries up the river. When the missionaries finally arrive at the Karen village, they find themselves part of a raid by the sadistic Major Pa Tee Tint and a slew of Burmese army men. A portion of the villagers and missionaries are tortured and viciously murdered, while Tint and his men hold the remainder captive. Concerned by their disappearance, the minister in charge of the mission gathers a group of mercenaries and pleas Rambo transport them with his boat, since he knows their last exact location.

This documentary by award-winning filmmaker Marc Levin (SLAM, Mr. Untouchable, Brick City) exposes how the infiltration of crack cocaine destroyed inner-city neighborhoods across the country. At the center of it all is the rise, fall and redemption of Freeway Rick Ross, a street hustler who became the King of Crack, and journalist Gary Webb, who broke the story of the CIA&amp;#39;s complicity in the drug war. Featuring exclusive interviews with Freeway Rick Ross, not to be confused with the rapper who took his name Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb, his source Coral Baca, and wife Susan Webb former Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff Roberto Juarez drug trafficker Julio Zavala and many more. The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection. His story defies all odds and stereotypes and proves that truth is indeed stranger than fiction.","country":"USA, Nicaragua","language":"English","imdbid":"tt3548962"},"mgname":["Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Warren G.","Freeway Rick Ross"]},{"creator":["Marc Levin"]},{"director":["Marc Levin"]}],"country":[]}}

At first glance their life seems idyllic; they call each other &amp;#39;Mother&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Father&amp;#39; and seem to dote on the kids. But Kelly was a garage-band crooner whose voice was ruined in an auto accident. He&amp;#39;s resigned to a dead-end factory job that barely pays the bills, and is given to fits of alcohol-induced rage. Evelyn, a stay-at-home wife and mother, deals with this abuse by appealing to her priest, who is no help at all. She deals with their poverty by entering the jingle contests that were the rage in the 50&amp;#39;s and early 60&amp;#39;s, even sending in multiple entries in the names of the children. She is very clever at it, winning more than her share of prizes, but her successes aren&amp;#39;t enough to keep the wolf from the door. Further, they trigger Kelly&amp;#39;s insecurities and he retreats deeper into the bottle, using food and mortgage money to support the habit. Can the loving, optimistic Evelyn hold the family together? Is she justified in placing her faith in the deeply-flawed Kelly? How will the children turn out? This underrated film provides an inspirational answer to these questions.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0406158"},"mgname":["Independent Dramas","Dramas","20th Century Period Pieces","Independent Films","Dramas based on a book","Dramas based on real life","Dramas based on contemporary literature"],"Genreid":["384","5763","12739","7077","4961","3653","12994"],"people":[{"actor":["Julianne Moore","Woody Harrelson","Laura Dern","Trevor Morgan","Erik Knudsen","Jordan Todosey","Colin Ford","Ellary Porterfield","Frank Chiesurin","Simon Reynolds","Melanie Tonello"]},{"creator":["Terry Ryan","Jane Anderson"]},{"director":["Jane Anderson"]}],"country":[]}}

That all changed in June, 2011 when he was forced to resign in disgrace after admitting that he did tweet lewd &amp;#39;headless&amp;#39; photos of himself from his public Twitter account to women he met online, and that it was not the work of a hacker or that the photos were of someone else. At the time, his wife Huma Abedin, herself a key aide to Hillary Clinton, was pregnant with their first child, she who decided to stand by her man. Two years later with Abedin still by his side, Weiner tries to resurrect his political career in a run for New York City mayor. He realizes that he has an uphill battle not only because of the known previously tweeted photos, but that there are other lewd photos from that era that may also come to light during the campaign. Regardless of the 2011 resignation, Weiner may not want to admit that any wrongdoing in his personal life should affect his ability to do his job as a politician, congressman, mayor or otherwise. He is probably well aware that the behavior associated with the tweeted photos will dog him during the entire election campaign - with some voters not caring what he does in his personal life, some never willing to forgive or forget such behavior, and some in the middle, those who he has to convince to vote for him. But will the collective &amp;#39;they&amp;#39; - including his campaign staff and Abedin - care and forgive a second time around if the behavior has continued, especially if he did or does not own up to it?","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt5278596"},"mgname":["Award-winning Movies","Documentaries","Biographical Documentaries"],"Genreid":["89844","6839","3652"],"people":[{"actor":["Anthony Weiner","Huma Abedin","Amit Bagga","Adam S.

She ghosts writes a young adult series of books, which has just been canceled due to low sales. She is in the process of writing the last book, with which she is having a mental block. She lives vicariously through Kendall Strickland, the teenaged female heroine in her books, as like Kendall she believes her high school years were the best years of her life when she was the prom queen. When she receives news that her high school beau, Buddy Slade, and his wife, Beth Slade, have just had their first child, Mavis takes it as a sign that she and Buddy are meant to be together. As such, she devises a false pretense to travel from her Minneapolis home back her her old hometown of Mercury, Minnesota to reclaim Buddy from Beth. As Mavis slyly or not so slyly does whatever she can to hang out with Buddy, even in Beth&amp;#39;s company if need be, she also runs into another old high school colleague named Matt Freehauf. She barely remembers Matt until she is reminded that he was the &amp;#39;hate crime&amp;#39; kid i.e. he was beaten almost to death by the school jocks who believed he was gay (which he is not), which has left him among other things needing to walk with a brace. Matt ends up being Mavis&amp;#39; drinking buddy and confidante, Matt, in turn, who tries to be Mavis&amp;#39; voice of reason to get her out of her delusional state about Buddy and get a grip on reclaiming her life as a functioning adult.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1625346"},"mgname":["Independent Dramas","Dramas","Independent Films","Independent Comedies","Comedies"],"Genreid":["384","5763","7077","4195","6548"],"people":[{"actor":["Charlize Theron","Patton Oswalt","Patrick Wilson","Kate Nowlin","Collette Wolfe","Elizabeth Reaser","Jill Eikenberry","Richard Bekins","Mary Beth Hurt"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Jason Reitman"]}],"country":[{"country":"Australia ","ccode":"au","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["English","Italian","Vietnamese","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"23","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["German","Greek","English","French","Turkish"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Iceland ","ccode":"is","seasons":"","new":"2017-01-18","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["Danish","English","Icelandic"],"cid":"265","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2018-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Hindi"],"subs":["English","Hindi"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-05","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","Greek","English","French","Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Japanese","Korean"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Sweden ","ccode":"se","seasons":"","new":"2018-07-18","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["German","English","Finnish","Norwegian","Swedish"],"cid":"73","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-24","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["German","English","French","Italian","Portuguese"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United States","ccode":"us","seasons":"","new":"2019-11-20","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["English","Spanish","French","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"78","islive":"yes"}]}}

In the present day, Jane Foster awaits the return of Thor although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall, who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor&amp;#39;s mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki.

Outwardly Charles built it so that they can spend time there to reconnect as a family, but they all know that he really built it to support the business. They as a family have long not been happy, as workaholic Charles is always concerned the company is close to folding, especially if he doesn&amp;#39;t keep an eye on matters, while Judith feels like he treats their entire family as second priority to the work and the associated money and material wealth.

They receive a surprise knock on their door from the Tuckers - parents Joe and Amy, and their two children, fifteen year old Robbie and fourteen year old Lucie - who ran off the road in their van on their way to a day ski trip, they who need shelter until the storm blows over. Unlike the Montgomerys, the Tuckers are a loving, happy family, who support each other as a family unit. The Montgomerys and the Tuckers do bond during their confined time together, but the sheer presence of the Tuckers may not be enough in and of itself to demonstrate to the Montgomerys what they need to do to avert the break-up of their family.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt4480940"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Family Dramas","Children & Family Films","Family Features"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","31901","783","51056"],"people":[{"actor":["Catherine Lough Haggquist","Nick Purcha","Colin Lawrence","Lizzie Boys","Kolton Stewart","Chris Potter","Jaeda Lily  Miller","Kristy Swanson"]},{"creator":["Kenneth Atchity","Chi-Li Wong","Julie Brazier","Rexanne Becnel"]},{"director":["George Erschbamer"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

But this murder investigation is drawing Vincent home to Long Beach, the self-proclaimed City by the Sea, where the past has been waiting for him to return. The agonizing memory that has tortured him all his life--the death of his father, a convicted murderer who was executed when Vincent was just a boy--still plagues him. In the course of the investigation, he discovers that his own unresolved pain and failures as a father have deeply influenced Joey&amp;#39;s life, and now his 18-month-old grandson may be fated to follow their self-destructive paths.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0269095"},"mgname":["Crime Films","Dramas","Mysteries","Crime Dramas"],"Genreid":["5824","5763","9994","6889"],"people":[{"actor":["Robert De Niro","Frances McDormand","James Franco","Eliza Dushku","George Dzundza","Patti LuPone","William Forsythe","Drena DeNiro","Anson Mount","John Doman","Brian Tarantina","Nestor Serrano"]},{"creator":["Mike McAlary","Ken Hixon"]},{"director":["Michael Caton-Jones"]}],"country":[{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"}]}}

Charged with selling two illegal sawed-off shotguns to an undercover agent, Weaver had failed to appear in court and law enforcement was tasked with bringing him in. For months, the Weavers had been holed up on their property with a cache of firearms, including automatic weapons. When the federal agents surveilling the property crossed paths with members of the family, a firefight broke out. The standoff that mesmerized the nation would leave Weaver injured, his wife and son dead, and some convinced that the federal government was out of control. Drawing upon eyewitness accounts, including interviews with Weaver&amp;#39;s daughter, Sara, and federal agents involved in the confrontation, Ruby Ridge is a riveting account of the event that helped give rise to the modern American militia movement.","country":"N/A","language":"English","imdbid":"tt6539426"},"mgname":["TV Documentaries","Documentaries","TV Programmes"],"Genreid":["10105","6839","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Sara Weaver","Dave Hunt","Bo Gritz"]},{"creator":["Barak Goodman","Don Kleszy"]},{"director":["Barak Goodman"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2017-04-19","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United States","ccode":"us","seasons":"","new":"2017-04-19","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"78","islive":"yes"}]}}
