In the simplest and in their own terms, Claire is a princess, Andrew an athlete, John a criminal, Brian a brain, and Allison a basket case. But one other thing they do have in common is a nine hour detention in the school library together on Saturday, March 24, 1984, under the direction of Mr. Vernon, supervising from his office across the hall. Each is required to write a minimum one thousand word essay during that time about who they think they are. At the beginning of those nine hours, each, if they were indeed planning on writing that essay, would probably write something close to what the world sees of them, and what they have been brainwashed into believing of themselves. But based on their adventures during that nine hours, they may come to a different opinion of themselves and the other four.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0088847"},"mgname":["Dramas","Cult Comedies","Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","9434","6548"],"people":[{"actor":["Molly Ringwald","Paul Gleason","Ally Sheedy","Anthony Michael Hall","John Kapelos","Emilio Estevez","Judd Nelson"]},{"creator":["John Hughes"]},{"director":["John Hughes"]}],"country":[]}}

He makes a hue and cry in the village saying God made an appearance for him. Anna (Dilip Prabhavalkar), most respected figure of Mangrul, advises him against announcing such personal matter as it&amp;#39;s a question of faith. However, it is too late as a journalist (Kishor Kadam) sensationalizes the news about Lord Dattatrey making an appearance in Mangrul. There is now a demand for a Dattatrey temple. Bhau (Nana Patekar), a political activist, doesn&amp;#39;t approve it as he wants the funds to be used for better purposes but he seems helpless. The temple is built and the village becomes a holy place. Mangrul goes through a 360 degree change due to commercialization but nobody is complaining except Anna. Soon, blinded by the commercial progress, God is forgotten. Every village has a right to progress commercially but how ethical it is to use a temple and its God to achieve it?

A man who lives for his religion, soaked in years of ancient traditions, values and morals. He is a strict, yet lovable man. As any real priest would, Chaturvedi believes he is a disciple of God on this earth to spread God&amp;#39;s message and love as he goes about his rigidly ritualistic world of pooja&amp;#39;s and teachings. One day his daughter brings home an infant (Krish Parekh) and the mother of the infant has disappeared and cannot be found nowhere. Pandit Chaturvedi is hesitant to have the child around the house at first, and when it&amp;#39;s confirmed that the child has been abandoned, he then makes the decision that the child will be raised in the local orphanage. However the Pandit&amp;#39;s wife Parvati (Supriya Pathak Kapur) has by now developed a soft spot for the young child and requests her husband if they can keep and raise the child if as their own. Hesitant at first, the priest reluctantly agrees as his wife lies to him that the baby is the son of a Brahmin. Slowly, the child wins over everyone hearts in the house including Pandit Chaturvedi who finds a son, a disciple and a best friend in the child. The story takes a turn when the baby&amp;#39;s mother returns to claim him back, and much to the shock of Pandit Chaturvedi, the lady is a Muslim. The child who they&amp;#39;d fondly named Karthik is in fact Mustafa. Pandit Chaturvedi is in a state of shock and utter despair as he feels he has done the biggest sin of his life and feel as if he has betrayed his religion and more-so God. In a state of recluse and regret, Pandit Chaturvedi decides to take a series of different vows and &amp;#39;vraths&amp;#39; to clear his conscience. However whilst his mind is telling him he has done a grave sin, his heart sorely misses his little son, and the words &amp;#39;babuji&amp;#39; echo in every corridor of the house. In a series of events, riots break out in the city of Varanasi, Mustafa&amp;#39;s mum begs and pleads the Pandit and his family to take back the little boy as he is much safer with them. However the doors of the house are closed for the little boy. What follows next can only be only described as a journey as Pandit Chaturvedi defies what he has believed his entire life if &amp;#39;religion&amp;#39; and listens to his inner conscience in the rousing finale.","country":"India","language":"Hindi","imdbid":"tt1047459"},"mgname":["International Films","International Dramas","Indian Films","Bollywood Films","Dramas","Musicals"],"Genreid":["78367","852493","10463","5480","5763","13335"],"people":[{"actor":["Pankaj Kapur","Suruchi Aulakh","K.K.

The Forces are encountering resistance from insurgents as they construct &amp;#39;Hyena Road&amp;#39; deep into Taliban territory. Warrant Officer Ryan Sanders, the leader of a rifle squad, finds himself under heavy fire while on sentry duty on the road. After their assigned evacuation vehicles are unable to reach their location, the squad moves on foot and reaches a Pashtun village. There are harbored by a tribal elder in his home, who also sends the Taliban away after they attack the village with rockets while searching for the Canadians. Sanders and his squad evacuate the area and return to base, where his secret lover Captain Jennifer Bowman, a communications officer, is also stationed. Meanwhile, Captain Pete Mitchell, an intelligence officer, carries out normal duties as the road is constructed, with little help from the Canadian&amp;#39;s Afghani allies. When he hears Sanders&amp;#39; story of the Afghani elder, he decides to search for the man as a potential ally. He is helped in his search by a local asset assisting against the Taliban, called The Cleaner. While a search of the village yields nothing, Sanders&amp;#39; is able to remember that the elder has eyes of two different colors, with one being brown and the other blue. Mitchell is immediately able to identify the man as &amp;#39;the Ghost&amp;#39;, formerly a fighter against the Soviets who gained his nickname for disappearing every-time he was injured, since his comrades would take him across the mountains into Pakistan, out of the range of the Soviets. Mitchell eventually arranges a meeting with the Ghost, but he refuses to accept money as a deal for his help, stating that he is now an old man and his days of combat are behind him. Meanwhile, the Canadians Afghani Allies, BDK and his son, Karim, are double-crossing them and receiving bribes from the Taliban. Sanders&amp;#39; squad sees this firsthand while observing the Ghost visit his son&amp;#39;s home and granddaughters. The home was situated on land owned by BDK, while the crops had been destroyed by a Coalition airstrike some time in the past, leaving the Ghost&amp;#39;s son with nothing to give BDK as his tithe for protection. Soon after the Ghost leaves, BDK arrives with Taliban protection and instructs the Ghost&amp;#39;s son to pay up his money. When the son states that the entire opium crop was destroyed, BDK takes the Ghost&amp;#39;s granddaughters and drive away. Sander&amp;#39;s fireteam observe the whole seen and are desperate to prevent BDK from taking the children, but Mitchell repeatedly instructs them to hold their fire as they do not fully understand local politics. While everyone in the Canadian intelligence group knows their Afghani allies are crooked, there is no alternative in the province and they need all the help they can get. Meanwhile, Bowman reveals to Sanders that she is pregnant with his son, having conceived while both were on leave. Sanders rejoices in this, despite it being a serious problem regarding military rules prohibiting fraternization between officers and NCOs. The Canadians follow the Ghost, who has declared a personal war on BDK in revenge for the kidnapping of the girls. With assistance from his tribe, the Ghost abducts BDK&amp;#39;s son Karim and beheads him when he is unable to reveal the location of the girls. Following this, the Ghost arranges a meeting with BDK in an isolated house, at the same time when BDK is supposed to be with the Canadians as they commemorate the opening of Hyena road. BDK agrees to exchange the girls for Karim. However, when BDK arrives with his bodyguards in a convoy, he demands to know the location of his son. The Ghost response by opening a sac he has brought and holding up Karim&amp;#39;s severed head, at which point BDK pulls out his pistol and threatens to kill the Ghost. Sanders and his squad, who have been watching the whole action, fires on BDK as they have positive intent of violence. They do not, however, know that the Ghost desired to die having nothing else to live for, and only wanted to avenge his grandchildren who he assumed were lost forever.A firefight ensues after BDK is shot in the head by the Canadians, and the Canadians soon drive off BDK&amp;#39;s bodyguards and begin moving out. As they move down to the house, dozens of Taliban insurgents arrive and they are trapped with the Ghost around the house. Although they fight off the insurgents, there is no support available and the Canadians are pinned down. After Travis, one of the members of Sanders&amp;#39; squad, is shot in the head by a sniper, the squad decides to relocate into the house under heavy enemy fire. As they move, they run into IEDs and the squad is incapacitated, with only Sander being able-bodied, along with the Ghost. Recognizing that there is no escape, Sanders calls in for artillery ordering to fire on his exact location to eliminate the insurgents, instructing them to fire for effect. After apologizing for the last time to Bowman, who heavily weeping tries to countermand the order, Sanders pulls off his helmet and tells the Ghost that he was going to be a father, something the Ghost appears to understand despite him not speaking English. Moments later, the artillery rounds hit the house obliterating Sanders, the Ghost, his squad, and many of the Taliban insurgents around them. The movie ends as Canadian troops rescue numerous Afghani children including the Ghost&amp;#39;s granddaughters from one of BDK&amp;#39;s safehouses, having acted on the Cleaner&amp;#39;s information and other assets. Mitchell talks about how things will eventually get better, in the long term.","country":"Canada","language":"English","imdbid":"tt4034452"},"mgname":["Military Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure","Dramas","Military Dramas"],"Genreid":["2125","1365","5763","11"],"people":[{"actor":["Paul Gross","David Richmond-Peck","Karl Campbell","Nikki Duval","Nabil Elouahabi","Christine Horne","Clark Johnson","Rossif Sutherland","Jennifer Pudavick","Neamat Arghandabi","Allan Hawco"]},{"creator":["Paul Gross"]},{"director":["Paul Gross"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2020-01-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"}]}}

And that is exactly what happens to firefighter Jeff Elliott and his wife Ruth who are living their dream in the golden Midwest; high school sweethearts, married with two beautiful and healthy children, family farm, horses, sports, church groups, the whole American Dream come true. And one winters day, teenage son Eric &amp;#39;Hoovey&amp;#39; Elliott collapses at high school basketball practice, is rushed to the hospital, and the doctors find a tumor the size of an orange at the base of his brain. They&amp;#39;re down to hours-if surgery that risks the boy&amp;#39;s ability to walk, talk, and perhaps even survive is not performed immediately, Hoovey&amp;#39;s young life will end before it truly even begins. In a grueling 8-hour procedure, the tumor is removed. And he survives. But for the Elliott family, life and dreams will never be the same. Hoovey has to teach himself to walk again, to read again, to even see straight with two unbalanced eyes, covered one at a time by an eye patch. Forget ever stepping on a basketball court - the risk of receiving a fatal blow to the spot on his head is just too great. As the unpaid medical bills mount, Jeff&amp;#39;s firefighting salary isn&amp;#39;t enough, the family is swimming in crippling debt seemingly overnight, everything he and Ruth have built in their life dream of two kids is at stake. Hoovey&amp;#39;s teenage sister Jen feels alone and nearly forgotten in the most important time of her life. And as Hoovey realizes his one dream in life-playing this game-is gone, too, he sinks into a deep sadness. This is a family at risk. With no-one to turn to, but themselves and their God. HOOVEY is the true and inspiring story of the Elliott family, who refused to surrender, instead turning to one another and their faith in the worst of circumstances, to rebuild their lives, their boy, and their dreams... together. Step by grueling step, with faith, love, and the tireless work of a mother and father to save their family, their farm, their dream, Hoovey learns to walk again. To read again. To dribble and shoot a basketball again. And yes, to dream again himself. Then stepping out in his faith, back onto the hard court, to live that dream of playing this game once more...","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2828884"},"mgname":["Faith & Spirituality","Faith & Spirituality Films","Tearjerkers","Dramas"],"Genreid":["26835","52804","6384","5763"],"people":[{"actor":["Alexandria Deberry","Stephen Baldwin","Lauren Holly","Cody Linley","Glenn Morshower","Charles Robinson","Brandon Mychal Smith","Patrick Warburton","Alyson Stoner"]},{"creator":["Howard Klausner"]},{"director":["Sean McNamara"]}],"country":[]}}

During this period, he brought many technical innovations to the developing Tamil Film Industry of the 1930s and &amp;#39;40s, and infused a sense of professionalism into its filmmaking. All this, without understanding a word of the language! Dungan also served the Madras Government in World War II.

The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency.

But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta&amp;#39;s handler doesn&amp;#39;t like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life.

When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels.

The grandson is sure he won&amp;#39;t like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and &amp;#39;no kissing&amp;#39;. But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of &amp;#39;as you wish&amp;#39; to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0093779"},"mgname":["Family Features","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Cult Comedies","Fantasy","Romantic Favourites","Family Comedies","Romantic Comedies","Cult Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Family Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Comedies","Adventures","Action & Adventure","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["51056","1492","9434","9744","502675","52847","5475","4734","52849","783","561","6548","7442","1365","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Cary Elwes","Peter Cook","Peter Falk","Christopher Guest","Andre the Giant","Mandy Patinkin","Wallace Shawn","Fred Savage","Robin Wright","Chris Sarandon","Billy Crystal"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Rob Reiner"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"}]}}

When Harry&amp;#39;s instructions arrive, Ken, for whom the job is directed, isn&amp;#39;t sure if he can carry out the new job, especially as he has gained a new appreciation of life from his stay in the fairytale Bruges. While Ken waits for the inevitable arrival into Bruges of an angry Harry, who feels he must clean up matters on his own, Ray is dealing with his own problems, not only with Harry, but with a Canadian couple and a half-blind thief named Eirik. Ray hopes he can count on both Chloe and Ken to help him carve out a new life for himself.

She lives at the track with her uncle Eddie, a horse trainer in the race circuit. Danny knows the horses. Danny knows the scams, and just how and when the races are fixed. Danny knows the odds makers-they depend on her for the inside story. And Danny knows that things are going to go nowhere for Uncle Eddie unless he can make his name with one great horse, a horse &amp;#39;you can ride into the money.&amp;#39; Danny has found such a horse. Tom Thumb, a yearling up for sale, has champion potential and she knows it. She isn&amp;#39;t fooled by Noel Ferguson, a big-time trainer who is talking Tom Thumb down. And when Moe Tully arrives in town, Danny knows it can only mean one thing-that races are going to be fixed. But there&amp;#39;s opportunity in that for her. Placing her bets before school and picking up her winnings after, she is soon able to bankroll Uncle Eddie, along with her friend Gerald, a groom at a competing stable who is ready to stake his savings on Tom Thumb. When Danny&amp;#39;s hunch proves correct and Tom Thumb turns out to be a winner, she, Uncle Eddie, and Gerald head off in style for the summer racing season. Other owners seek out the &amp;#39;Bara magic&amp;#39; and for awhile Uncle Eddie can do no wrong. It&amp;#39;s no surprise when Noel Ferguson offers Eddie fifty thousand dollars for Tom Thumb and tells him he&amp;#39;ll take it if he knows what&amp;#39;s good for him. When Eddie refuses, he and Danny, Gerald and even Tom Thumb get a dose of all the dirty dealing the racing circuit can dish out. But Danny, as we&amp;#39;ve seen, is nobody&amp;#39;s fool, and even Uncle Eddie has picked up a thing or two lately. In spite of just about everything that comes their way, they&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;in the money&amp;#39; and it&amp;#39;s one great season on the racing circuit.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0113330"},"mgname":["Dramas","Animal Tales","Children & Family Movies"],"Genreid":["5763","5507","783"],"people":[{"actor":["Erik Jensen","Brian Michael","Ron Brice","Ed Grady","Gary Basaraba","Leelee Sobieski","Karen Carlson","Ed Bruce","Robert Urich"]},{"creator":["Remi Aubuchon"]},{"director":["Dick Lowry"]}],"country":[]}}

A small group of survivors find themselves unlikely allies in a battle for their lives. Preferring to test the odds alone, career gambler Dylan Johns ignores captain&amp;#39;s orders to wait below for possible rescue and sets out to find his own way to safety. What begins as a solo mission soon draws others, as Dylan is followed by a desperate father searching for his daughter and her fianc&eacute;e--a young couple who hours before couldn&amp;#39;t summon the courage to tell him they were engaged and now face much graver challenges.

No longer is sex, weight, height and orientation a factor. This now allows for an insurgence of people applying. The Police Academy series follows a select group of misfits in their quest to become police men and women. The first film of the series follows these misfits in their time at the Police Academy. The main focus is on a petty criminal called Mahoney. Mahoney is busted for criminal damage and as punishment is forced to go to Police Academy. Mahoney initially feels that this isn&amp;#39;t the right place for him and he makes it his mission to be thrown out as he is not allowed to quit. As the classes go by and the training exercises are played out, Mahoney soon realizes that he is actually enjoying the academy and does want to become a police officer. We are also introduced to the gun maniac Tackelberry, the very tall Hightower, voluptuous Callahan, squeaky Hooks, human beat box and sound effects master Jones and the ever confuzzled Commandant Lassard. This group become good friends and become the base for the rest of the series of films.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0087928"},"mgname":["Crime Films","Slapstick Comedies","Action Comedies","Comedies","Late Night Comedies","Crime Comedies","Action & Adventure","Police Detective Movies","Crime Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5824","10256","43040","6548","1402","4058","1365","79049","9584"],"people":[{"actor":["Kim Cattrall","G.W.

Anna (Dilip Prabhavalkar), most respected figure of Mangrul, advises him against announcing such personal matter as it&amp;#39;s a question of faith. However, it is too late as a journalist (Kishor Kadam) sensationalizes the news about Lord Dattatrey making an appearance in Mangrul. There is now a demand for a Dattatrey temple. Bhau (Nana Patekar), a political activist, doesn&amp;#39;t approve it as he wants the funds to be used for better purposes but he seems helpless. The temple is built and the village becomes a holy place. Mangrul goes through a 360 degree change due to commercialization but nobody is complaining except Anna. Soon, blinded by the commercial progress, God is forgotten. Every village has a right to progress commercially but how ethical it is to use a temple and its God to achieve it?

Now, former CIA assassin Mitch Leary is stalking the current President, who is running for re-election. Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan, telling him of his plans to kill the President. Leary plans to kill the president because Leary feels betrayed by the government -- Leary was removed from the CIA, and the CIA is now trying to have him killed. After talking to Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty, working with fellow secret service agent Lilly Raines. Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around, and he&amp;#39;s more than willing to take a bullet. White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent refuses to alter the President&amp;#39;s itinerary, while Horrigan&amp;#39;s boss, Secret Service Director Sam Campagna, is supportive of Horrigan. As the election gets closer, Horrigan begins to doubt his own abilities, especially when Horrigan&amp;#39;s colleague Al D&amp;#39;Andrea is killed by Leary. But Horrigan may be the only one who can stop Leary.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0107206"},"mgname":["Spy Action & Adventure","Police Action & Adventure","Action Thrillers","Action & Adventure","Crime Action & Adventure","Police Movies","Spy Action & Adventure","Police Action & Adventure","Action Thrillers","Action & Adventure","Crime Action & Adventure","Police Movies"],"Genreid":["10702","75418","43048","1365","9584","75436","10702","75418","43048","1365","9584","75436"],"people":[{"actor":["Rene Russo","John Malkovich","Clint Eastwood","Bob Schott","John Mahoney","Dylan McDermott","Sally Hughes","Tobin Bell","John Heard","Jim Curley","Gary Cole","Fred Dalton Thompson","Gregory Alan Williams"]},{"creator":["Jeff Maguire"]},{"director":["Wolfgang Petersen"]}],"country":[{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["English","French"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","French","Russian","Turkish"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"}]}}

A man who lives for his religion, soaked in years of ancient traditions, values and morals. He is a strict, yet lovable man. As any real priest would, Chaturvedi believes he is a disciple of God on this earth to spread God&amp;#39;s message and love as he goes about his rigidly ritualistic world of pooja&amp;#39;s and teachings. One day his daughter brings home an infant (Krish Parekh) and the mother of the infant has disappeared and cannot be found nowhere. Pandit Chaturvedi is hesitant to have the child around the house at first, and when it&amp;#39;s confirmed that the child has been abandoned, he then makes the decision that the child will be raised in the local orphanage. However the Pandit&amp;#39;s wife Parvati (Supriya Pathak Kapur) has by now developed a soft spot for the young child and requests her husband if they can keep and raise the child if as their own. Hesitant at first, the priest reluctantly agrees as his wife lies to him that the baby is the son of a Brahmin. Slowly, the child wins over everyone hearts in the house including Pandit Chaturvedi who finds a son, a disciple and a best friend in the child. The story takes a turn when the baby&amp;#39;s mother returns to claim him back, and much to the shock of Pandit Chaturvedi, the lady is a Muslim. The child who they&amp;#39;d fondly named Karthik is in fact Mustafa. Pandit Chaturvedi is in a state of shock and utter despair as he feels he has done the biggest sin of his life and feel as if he has betrayed his religion and more-so God. In a state of recluse and regret, Pandit Chaturvedi decides to take a series of different vows and &amp;#39;vraths&amp;#39; to clear his conscience. However whilst his mind is telling him he has done a grave sin, his heart sorely misses his little son, and the words &amp;#39;babuji&amp;#39; echo in every corridor of the house. In a series of events, riots break out in the city of Varanasi, Mustafa&amp;#39;s mum begs and pleads the Pandit and his family to take back the little boy as he is much safer with them. However the doors of the house are closed for the little boy. What follows next can only be only described as a journey as Pandit Chaturvedi defies what he has believed his entire life if &amp;#39;religion&amp;#39; and listens to his inner conscience in the rousing finale.","country":"India","language":"Hindi","imdbid":"tt1047459"},"mgname":["International Films","International Dramas","Indian Films","Bollywood Films","Dramas","Musicals"],"Genreid":["78367","852493","10463","5480","5763","13335"],"people":[{"actor":["Pankaj Kapur","Suruchi Aulakh","K.K.

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

At first glance their life seems idyllic; they call each other &amp;#39;Mother&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Father&amp;#39; and seem to dote on the kids. But Kelly was a garage-band crooner whose voice was ruined in an auto accident. He&amp;#39;s resigned to a dead-end factory job that barely pays the bills, and is given to fits of alcohol-induced rage. Evelyn, a stay-at-home wife and mother, deals with this abuse by appealing to her priest, who is no help at all. She deals with their poverty by entering the jingle contests that were the rage in the 50&amp;#39;s and early 60&amp;#39;s, even sending in multiple entries in the names of the children. She is very clever at it, winning more than her share of prizes, but her successes aren&amp;#39;t enough to keep the wolf from the door. Further, they trigger Kelly&amp;#39;s insecurities and he retreats deeper into the bottle, using food and mortgage money to support the habit. Can the loving, optimistic Evelyn hold the family together? Is she justified in placing her faith in the deeply-flawed Kelly? How will the children turn out? This underrated film provides an inspirational answer to these questions.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0406158"},"mgname":["Independent Dramas","Dramas","20th Century Period Pieces","Independent Films","Dramas based on a book","Dramas based on real life","Dramas based on contemporary literature"],"Genreid":["384","5763","12739","7077","4961","3653","12994"],"people":[{"actor":["Julianne Moore","Woody Harrelson","Laura Dern","Trevor Morgan","Erik Knudsen","Jordan Todosey","Colin Ford","Ellary Porterfield","Frank Chiesurin","Simon Reynolds","Melanie Tonello"]},{"creator":["Terry Ryan","Jane Anderson"]},{"director":["Jane Anderson"]}],"country":[]}}

When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle.

They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs.

Although connected indirectly through Will&amp;#39;s mother/Edward&amp;#39;s wife, Sandra Bloom, Will has been estranged from his father for three years since his and Josephine&amp;#39;s wedding. Will&amp;#39;s issue with his father is the fanciful tales Edward has told of his life all his life, not only to Will but the whole world. As a child when Edward was largely absent as a traveling salesman, Will believed those stories, but now realizes that he does not know his father, who, as he continues to tell these stories, he will never get to know unless Edward comes clean with the truth before he dies. On the brink of his own family life beginning, Will does not want to be the kind of father Edward has been to him. One of those stories from Edward&amp;#39;s childhood - that he saw his own death in the glass eye of a witch - led to him embracing life since he would not have to fear death knowing when and how it would eventually come. The question is whether Will will be able to reconcile Edward&amp;#39;s stories against his real life, either directly from Edward before he dies and/or from other sources, and thus allow Will to come to a new understanding of himself and his life, past, present and future.","country":"USA","language":"English, Cantonese","imdbid":"tt0319061"},"mgname":["Dramas","20th Century Period Pieces","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","Dramas based on a book","Tearjerkers","Dramas based on contemporary literature"],"Genreid":["5763","12739","1492","9744","4961","6384","12994"],"people":[{"actor":["Billy Crudup","Ewan McGregor","David Denman","Robert Guillaume","Loudon Wainwright III","Marion Cotillard","Matthew McGrory","Albert Finney","Helena Bonham Carter","Alison Lohman","Jessica Lange","Missi Pyle"]},{"creator":["Daniel Wallace"]},{"director":["Tim Burton"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Spanish","Italian"],"subs":["Arabic","German","English","Spanish","Italian"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["German","English","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Czech","German","English","Polish"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-28","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["German","English","French","Hungarian","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese","Korean","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Lithuania ","ccode":"lt","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English","Russian"],"cid":"357","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["Arabic","German","Greek","English","Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["German","English","Polish","Russian","Ukrainian"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-02","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Polish"],"subs":["English","European Spanish","French","Hungarian","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Czech","German","English","Hungarian","Ukrainian"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese","Korean"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

Curt, who received a lucrative local scholarship, is seen as the promise that their class holds. But Curt is having second thoughts about leaving what Steve basically sees as their dead end town. Curt&amp;#39;s beliefs are strengthened when he spots an unknown beautiful blonde in a T-bird who mouths the words &amp;#39;I love you&amp;#39; to him. As Curt tries to find that blonde while trying to get away from a local gang who have him somewhat hostage, Curt may come to a decision about his immediate future. Outgoing class president Steve, on the other hand, wants to leave, despite meaning that he will leave girlfriend, head cheerleader and Curt&amp;#39;s sister, Laurie Henderson, behind. Steve and Laurie spend the evening &amp;#39;negotiating&amp;#39; the state of their relationship. Meanwhile, two of their friends cruise around town for the evening.

And John Milner, who is seen as the king of the street race in his souped-up yellow deuce coupe, tries to get rid of precocious pre-teen, Carol Morrison, who has somehow become his passenger for the evening, while dealing with the challenge of bold out-of-towner, Bob Falfa.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0069704"},"mgname":["Critically-acclaimed Dramas","Dramas","Comedies","Classic Films","Critically-acclaimed Comedies","20th Century Period Pieces","Critically-acclaimed Films","Golden Globe Award-winning Films"],"Genreid":["6206","5763","6548","31574","9736","12739","3979","82489"],"people":[{"actor":["Harrison Ford","Candy Clark","Richard Dreyfuss","Beau Gentry","Bo Hopkins","Charles Martin Smith","Paul Le Mat","Manuel Padilla Jr.","Jim Bohan","Deby Celiz","Mackenzie Phillips","Suzanne Somers","Wolfman Jack","Jana Bellan","Ron Howard","Cindy Williams"]},{"creator":["George Lucas","Gloria Katz","Willard Huyck"]},{"director":["George Lucas"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2020-01-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"}]}}

His office is comprised of his cell phone and whatever is stuffed in his satchel which is usually slung over his shoulder as he wanders the streets. What he promises is making connections, setting up a meeting between his guy and the other guy. Generally, &amp;#39;his guy&amp;#39; is non-existent, he dropping names of people he usually doesn&amp;#39;t know to make connections. A usual tactic he uses is to say that his deceased wife was personally connected to so-and-so, such as being a babysitter, those stories always untrue. All he needs is for one of the people that he approaches to believe a story to build that network. Not so much a story, but an act of kindness with that ulterior motive does eventually pan out as the connection of which he could have only dreamed. He is able to build off that connection to become the toast of the town, a status upon which he tries to parlay into being an even bigger fish in the pond. But the greater his exposure, the greater the potential scrutiny about him as a person, which could bring his fragile network come crumbling down around him.","country":"Israel, USA","language":"English, Hebrew","imdbid":"tt4191702"},"mgname":["Dramas","Thrillers","Political Dramas","Political Thrillers"],"Genreid":["5763","8933","6616","10504"],"people":[{"actor":["Dan Stevens","Steve Buscemi","Ari Schwartz","Harris Yulin","Miranda Bailey","Doval&amp;#39;e Glickman","Yehuda Almagor","Neta Riskin","Michael Sheen","Lior Ashkenazi","Tali Sharon","Hank Azaria","Josh Charles","Isaach De Bankole","Charlotte Gainsbourg","Richard Gere","Scott Shepherd","Dovale Glickman"]},{"creator":["Joseph Cedar"]},{"director":["Joseph Cedar"]}],"country":[]}}

Bryce begins to see that Juli&amp;#39;s unusual interests and pride in her family are, well, kind of cool.

One of the people to who she tells her story is Dempsy Police Detective Lorenzo Council, a black man. That story is that she was just carjacked by another unknown black man when she took a shortcut that she had never traveled between the Armstrong housing projects, where she works at the Rainbow Club, a children&amp;#39;s center, and her home in Gannon, New Jersey. Her emotional distress is because her four year old son, Cody, was asleep in the back seat of the car and is thus now in the hands of the carjacker. Brenda&amp;#39;s brother, Danny Martin, a police detective in Gannon, cannot help but get directly involved in the investigation despite he operating outside his jurisdiction. His actions do not sit well with Council, who he insinuates is not only not doing his job, but is protecting his own &amp;#39;people&amp;#39;, i.e. the primarily black populace in the Armstrong housing projects. In addition, the residents of the projects feel that Brenda is getting special treatment as a white woman, as several children have gone missing from the projects without such a frenzied police intervention, which is unnecessarily and unfairly disrupting their lives. Karen Collucci with Friends of Kent, a volunteer organization that conducts searches for missing children, also offers their services, which Council eventually accepts with the caveat that they work under his directive. &amp;#39;Kent&amp;#39; was Collucci&amp;#39;s own son never found, his disappearance which destroyed her personal life.

Scott and Mike seem to have a special connection. After Mike makes advances to Scott now that he and Fiona are not seeing each other, Scott abruptly sends Mike a message saying he never wants to hear from him again. However, Scott learns shorty thereafter that Mike is actually a beautiful girl named Mieke. By this time, Mieke has blocked his messages. Thinking that Mieke is actually who he was meant to be with, Scott, impulsively for a change, decides to go to Berlin to be with her. Along for the ride is Scott&amp;#39;s best friend, the girl crazy Cooper Harris. They manage only to get a flight into London, and thus have to make their way from London to Berlin. Along the way in Paris, they run into their high school friends, twins Jenny and Jamie, who are backpacking through Europe. Scott and Cooper consider them the most mismatched twins ever, Jamie who is a walking encyclopedia, and Jenny a girl who they treat as just one of the guys. As the four try to make their way to Berlin, they run into a few obstacles and few adventures. Scott hopes that all these problems are worth it when he has his much hyped in his mind meeting with Mieke.","country":"USA, Czech Republic","language":"English, French, German, Italian, Japanese","imdbid":"tt0356150"},"mgname":["Comedies"],"Genreid":["6548"],"people":[{"actor":["Jacob Pitts","Cathy Meils","Scott Mechlowicz","Kristin Kreuk","Michelle Trachtenberg","Nial Iskhakov","Matt Damon","Travis Wester","Jakki Degg","Molly Schade"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Jeff Schaffer","Alec Berg","David Mandel"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Spanish","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","French","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Spanish","French","Korean","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","French"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Spanish","French","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-31","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"}]}}

The grandson is sure he won&amp;#39;t like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and &amp;#39;no kissing&amp;#39;. But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of &amp;#39;as you wish&amp;#39; to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0093779"},"mgname":["Family Features","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Cult Comedies","Fantasy","Romantic Favourites","Family Comedies","Romantic Comedies","Cult Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Family Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Comedies","Adventures","Action & Adventure","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["51056","1492","9434","9744","502675","52847","5475","4734","52849","783","561","6548","7442","1365","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Cary Elwes","Peter Cook","Peter Falk","Christopher Guest","Andre the Giant","Mandy Patinkin","Wallace Shawn","Fred Savage","Robin Wright","Chris Sarandon","Billy Crystal"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Rob Reiner"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"}]}}

However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez devised a daring plan: create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew.

When Glabrus is defeated his mentor, Senator and General Marcus Licinius Crassus is greatly embarrassed and leads his own army against the slaves. Spartacus and the thousands of freed slaves successfully make their way to Brandisium only to find that the Silesians have abandoned them. They then turn north and must face the might of Rome.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0054331"},"mgname":["Action & Adventure","Classic Action & Adventure","Classic Films","Adventures","Epics"],"Genreid":["1365","46576","31574","7442","52858"],"people":[{"actor":["John Dall","Peter Ustinov","Charles McGraw","John Ireland","Woody Strode","Laurence Olivier","Herbert Lom","John Gavin","Tony Curtis","Nina Foch","Kirk Douglas","Jean Simmons","Charles Laughton"]},{"creator":["Dalton Trumbo","Howard Fast"]},{"director":["Stanley Kubrick"]}],"country":[{"country":"Australia ","ccode":"au","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["English","Italian","Vietnamese","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"23","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Czech","German","English","Polish"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","French","Turkish"],"subs":["German","Greek","English","French","Turkish"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["German","English","French","Hungarian","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Hindi"],"subs":["English","Hindi"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish","Russian"],"subs":["German","English","Polish","Russian"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Turkish"],"subs":["English","European Spanish","French","Hungarian","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Czech","German","English","Hungarian","Polish"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"}]}}

Joy feels that lack of practical support has led to others making fortunes on ideas she came up with years ago but could not act upon manufacturing. Despite being broke, Joy is the person in her extended family to whom everyone has always turned, in the process forgoing her own life, including not having attended college to help see her parents through their divorce. She works in an unsatisfying job as an Eastern Airlines ticket clerk; and lives with her mother Terry who spends all day in bed watching soap operas; her ex-husband Tony, a less than successful aspiring Latino Tom Jones wannabe; and their two children. Added to this mix is her father Rudy, the owner of a failing heavy-duty garage, which is managed by Joy&amp;#39;s older half-sister Peggy, with whom she has somewhat of a strained relationship, and for which Joy does the books. Sharon, Rudy&amp;#39;s latest girlfriend who has just dumped him, drops him off on Joy&amp;#39;s doorstep, making Joy&amp;#39;s home life even more complicated as Rudy does not get along with either Terry or Tony. Joy begins to feel buried by her life, in the process her childhood dream of making things seemingly getting farther and farther away. As such, Joy decides to make some changes in her life, and expects the unquestioning practical support of her family. Those changes include manufacturing a new product of her design; what she chooses this time around being a self-wringing mop. That support also includes being able to pitch the idea to Rudy&amp;#39;s current wealthy girlfriend, Trudy. Even if she does get to the manufacturing stage, Joy will have to battle the narrow minds of business executives in marketing her product, that is unless she can find a way to get into the homes of the American public in one fell swoop. But nothing is a done deal until the consumer forks out his/her hard earned money for the product and all the legal issues are dealt with. Joy has to decide if she will &amp;#39;pick up the gun&amp;#39; as Trudy asked in their initial investment meeting in dealing with an especially troublesome legal issue.","country":"USA","language":"English, Spanish, French","imdbid":"tt2446980"},"mgname":["Dramas based on real life","Biographical Dramas","Comedies","Dramas"],"Genreid":["3653","3179","6548","5763"],"people":[{"actor":["Jennifer Lawrence","Edgar Ramirez","Bradley Cooper","Robert De Niro","Susan Lucci","Isabella Rossellini","Virginia Madsen","Diane Ladd","Elisabeth Rohm","Dascha Polanco"]},{"creator":["David O.

In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney&amp;#39;s plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn&amp;#39;t budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.","country":"USA, UK, Australia","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2140373"},"mgname":["Dramas","Biographical Dramas","Comedies","Dramas based on real life"],"Genreid":["5763","3179","6548","3653"],"people":[{"actor":["Emma Thompson","Tom Hanks","Annie Rose Buckley","Colin Farrell","B.J.

She nevertheless little by little manages to find her footing by adapting to her job as a salesgirl, by studying bookkeeping at Brooklyn College as well as with a little help from both Father Flood and Mrs. Kehoe, the owner of the boarding school she now lives in. And not only does graduation follow but love shows its face in Tony, an Italian-American plumber, full of adoration and respect for her. They end up marrying, although keeping the thing secret. It is at that point that tragedy strikes inciting Eilis to return to Enniscorthy to support her mother morally. And there a strange thing happens : she gradually gets lured by the charms of her native place, going far as to let herself be wooed by Jim Farrell, a young local.","country":"UK, Canada, Ireland","language":"English, Latin, Irish","imdbid":"tt2381111"},"mgname":["Romantic Favourites","British Dramas","Dramas based on a book","20th Century Period Pieces","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Dramas","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["502675","3682","4961","12739","1255","10757","5763","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Jenn Murray","Fiona Glascott","Jim Broadbent","Michael Zegen","Jane Brennan","Julie Walters","Emory Cohen","Eva Birthistle","Brid Brennan","Saoirse Ronan","Eve Macklin","Jessica Pare","Domhnall Gleeson","Nora-Jane Noone","Hugh Gormley","Maeve McGrath"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Colm Toibin"]},{"director":["John Crowley"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Australia ","ccode":"au","seasons":"","new":"2018-12-08","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","Greek","English","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"23","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-25","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["Greek","English"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"}]}}

After financing the trips with loans and donations, they set off on an epic 101-day-long trip across 8000 kilometers, while the world was waiting for the result of the trip. The film tells about the origin of the idea, the preparations, and the events on the trip. The &amp;#39;Kon-Tiki&amp;#39; was named after the Inca sun god, Viracocha, and &amp;#39;Kon-Tiki&amp;#39; is an old name for this god. Heyerdahl filmed the expedition, which later became the Academy Award winning documentary in 1951, and he wrote a book about the expedition that was translated into 70 languages and sold more than 50 millions copies around the world. Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in pre-Columbian times, although most anthropologists now believe they did not. Anyway he proved that it was possible by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at that time. The trip took 101 days over 4,300 miles across the Pacific Ocean before the &amp;#39;Kon-Tiki&amp;#39; crashed onto the dangerous reefs outside Raroia in the Tuamotu Islands on August 7, 1947. All crewmen survived, and the &amp;#39;Kon-Tiki&amp;#39; was taken back to Norway. She is now featured in the Kon-Tiki Museum.","country":"UK, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Sweden","language":"Norwegian, English, French, Swedish","imdbid":"tt1613750"},"mgname":["Dramas","Scandinavian Films","International Movies","Adventures","Dramas based on real life"],"Genreid":["5763","9292","78367","7442","3653"],"people":[{"actor":["Eilif Hellum Noraker","Peter Wight","Odd Magnus Williamson","Jakob Oftebro","Gustaf Skarsgard","Agnes Kittelsen","Amund Hellum Noraker","Anders Baasmo Christiansen","Tobias Santelmann","Pal Sverre Valheim Hagen","P&aring;l Sverre Hagen"]},{"creator":["Petter Skavlan"]},{"director":["Joachim Ronning","Espen Sandberg","Joachim R&oslash;nning"]}],"country":[{"country":"Sweden ","ccode":"se","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["Norwegian"],"subs":["Danish","Finnish","Norwegian","Swedish"],"cid":"73","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United States","ccode":"us","seasons":"","new":"2019-04-26","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"78","islive":"yes"}]}}

Curt, who received a lucrative local scholarship, is seen as the promise that their class holds. But Curt is having second thoughts about leaving what Steve basically sees as their dead end town. Curt&amp;#39;s beliefs are strengthened when he spots an unknown beautiful blonde in a T-bird who mouths the words &amp;#39;I love you&amp;#39; to him. As Curt tries to find that blonde while trying to get away from a local gang who have him somewhat hostage, Curt may come to a decision about his immediate future. Outgoing class president Steve, on the other hand, wants to leave, despite meaning that he will leave girlfriend, head cheerleader and Curt&amp;#39;s sister, Laurie Henderson, behind. Steve and Laurie spend the evening &amp;#39;negotiating&amp;#39; the state of their relationship. Meanwhile, two of their friends cruise around town for the evening.

Veteran CIA operative Marty tells Miller that there are no weapons, it is a deception to allow the Americans to take over the country and install a puppet leader.

When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0314353"},"mgname":["Dramas","Military Dramas","Action Thrillers","Military Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5763","11","43048","2125","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Bruce Willis","Johnny Messner","Chad Smith","Eamonn Walker","Tom Skerritt","Charles Ingram","Malick Bowens","Monica Bellucci","Cole Hauser","Nick Chinlund","Paul Francis","Awaovieyi Agie"]},{"creator":["Alex Lasker","Patrick Cirillo"]},{"director":["Antoine Fuqua"]}],"country":[{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"}]}}

Most of that work is as a fixer: doing work that others don&amp;#39;t want to do and with which they don&amp;#39;t want to be officially associated. In reality, Norman is a shyster, and not a very good one at that. His office is comprised of his cell phone and whatever is stuffed in his satchel which is usually slung over his shoulder as he wanders the streets. What he promises is making connections, setting up a meeting between his guy and the other guy. Generally, &amp;#39;his guy&amp;#39; is non-existent, he dropping names of people he usually doesn&amp;#39;t know to make connections. A usual tactic he uses is to say that his deceased wife was personally connected to so-and-so, such as being a babysitter, those stories always untrue. All he needs is for one of the people that he approaches to believe a story to build that network. Not so much a story, but an act of kindness with that ulterior motive does eventually pan out as the connection of which he could have only dreamed. He is able to build off that connection to become the toast of the town, a status upon which he tries to parlay into being an even bigger fish in the pond. But the greater his exposure, the greater the potential scrutiny about him as a person, which could bring his fragile network come crumbling down around him.","country":"Israel, USA","language":"English, Hebrew","imdbid":"tt4191702"},"mgname":["Dramas","Thrillers","Political Dramas","Political Thrillers"],"Genreid":["5763","8933","6616","10504"],"people":[{"actor":["Dan Stevens","Steve Buscemi","Ari Schwartz","Harris Yulin","Miranda Bailey","Doval&amp;#39;e Glickman","Yehuda Almagor","Neta Riskin","Michael Sheen","Lior Ashkenazi","Tali Sharon","Hank Azaria","Josh Charles","Isaach De Bankole","Charlotte Gainsbourg","Richard Gere","Scott Shepherd","Dovale Glickman"]},{"creator":["Joseph Cedar"]},{"director":["Joseph Cedar"]}],"country":[]}}

A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage.

While Carol breaks free from the confines of marriage, her husband (Kyle Chandler) begins to question her competence as a mother as her involvement with Therese and close relationship with her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) come to light.","country":"UK, USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2402927"},"mgname":["Dramas","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Dramas","Romantic Films based on a book","Romantic Films","Dramas based on a book"],"Genreid":["5763","502675","1255","3830","8883","4961"],"people":[{"actor":["Kyle Chandler","Sarah Paulson","Carrie Brownstein","Cate Blanchett","Nik Pajic","Jake Lacy","Rooney Mara","Cory Michael Smith","John Magaro","Kevin Crowley"]},{"creator":["Phyllis Nagy","Patricia Highsmith"]},{"director":["Todd Haynes"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"France ","ccode":"fr","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["French"],"cid":"45","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Greek"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2018-04-03","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2017-01-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"}]}}

At the center of it all is the rise, fall and redemption of Freeway Rick Ross, a street hustler who became the King of Crack, and journalist Gary Webb, who broke the story of the CIA&amp;#39;s complicity in the drug war. Featuring exclusive interviews with Freeway Rick Ross, not to be confused with the rapper who took his name Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb, his source Coral Baca, and wife Susan Webb former Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff Roberto Juarez drug trafficker Julio Zavala and many more. The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection.

The grandson is sure he won&amp;#39;t like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and &amp;#39;no kissing&amp;#39;. But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of &amp;#39;as you wish&amp;#39; to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0093779"},"mgname":["Family Features","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Cult Comedies","Fantasy","Romantic Favourites","Family Comedies","Romantic Comedies","Cult Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Family Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Comedies","Adventures","Action & Adventure","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["51056","1492","9434","9744","502675","52847","5475","4734","52849","783","561","6548","7442","1365","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Cary Elwes","Peter Cook","Peter Falk","Christopher Guest","Andre the Giant","Mandy Patinkin","Wallace Shawn","Fred Savage","Robin Wright","Chris Sarandon","Billy Crystal"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Rob Reiner"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"}]}}

Although a dedicated man as seen through the efficiency in which he does his work, he can&amp;#39;t or won&amp;#39;t translate that eloquence into a better life for himself. He deludes himself into believing that his now twelve year cabbie job is temporary and that someday he will own his own limousine service. He even lies to his hospitalized mother that he already owns one, with a further lie that he tells her as such primarily to make her happy, rather than the truth which is that he won&amp;#39;t do anything to achieve that dream. One night, Max picks up a well dressed man named Vincent, who asks Max to be his only fare for the evening. For a flat fee of $600, plus an extra $100 if he gets to the airport on time - Vincent wants Max to drive him to five stops that evening. Max somewhat reluctantly agrees. Max learns the hard way at their first stop when a body falls from a third story apartment window and lands dead on top of his cab that Vincent is a contract hit man. Vincent&amp;#39;s main goal, as per his current contract, is to kill five people, one at each of the stops, but he will not let others get in the way of that goal, even if it means killing them, including Max. As Vincent forces Max to continue driving him for the evening, Max tries slyly at every turn to take back control of his life from Vincent, especially when Max learns of one of the names on Vincent&amp;#39;s hit list. Meanwhile, LAPD narcotics detective, Ray Fanning, and ultimately the FBI get involved when Vincent&amp;#39;s first victim is associated with a case in which Ray is working undercover. Ray is able to piece together information which makes him hot on Max and Vincent&amp;#39;s tail.","country":"USA","language":"English, Spanish, French, Korean","imdbid":"tt0369339"},"mgname":["Dramas","Thrillers","Film Noir","Police Thrillers","Police Dramas","Police Movies","Crime Thrillers","Crime Dramas"],"Genreid":["5763","8933","7687","75390","75459","75436","10499","6889"],"people":[{"actor":["Tom Cruise","Irma P.

Outwardly Charles built it so that they can spend time there to reconnect as a family, but they all know that he really built it to support the business. They as a family have long not been happy, as workaholic Charles is always concerned the company is close to folding, especially if he doesn&amp;#39;t keep an eye on matters, while Judith feels like he treats their entire family as second priority to the work and the associated money and material wealth. They make it to the cabin just before a major snowstorm hits the area. They receive a surprise knock on their door from the Tuckers - parents Joe and Amy, and their two children, fifteen year old Robbie and fourteen year old Lucie - who ran off the road in their van on their way to a day ski trip, they who need shelter until the storm blows over. Unlike the Montgomerys, the Tuckers are a loving, happy family, who support each other as a family unit. The Montgomerys and the Tuckers do bond during their confined time together, but the sheer presence of the Tuckers may not be enough in and of itself to demonstrate to the Montgomerys what they need to do to avert the break-up of their family.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt4480940"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Family Dramas","Children & Family Films","Family Features"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","31901","783","51056"],"people":[{"actor":["Catherine Lough Haggquist","Nick Purcha","Colin Lawrence","Lizzie Boys","Kolton Stewart","Chris Potter","Jaeda Lily  Miller","Kristy Swanson"]},{"creator":["Kenneth Atchity","Chi-Li Wong","Julie Brazier","Rexanne Becnel"]},{"director":["George Erschbamer"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

Joy feels that lack of practical support has led to others making fortunes on ideas she came up with years ago but could not act upon manufacturing. Despite being broke, Joy is the person in her extended family to whom everyone has always turned, in the process forgoing her own life, including not having attended college to help see her parents through their divorce. She works in an unsatisfying job as an Eastern Airlines ticket clerk; and lives with her mother Terry who spends all day in bed watching soap operas; her ex-husband Tony, a less than successful aspiring Latino Tom Jones wannabe; and their two children. Added to this mix is her father Rudy, the owner of a failing heavy-duty garage, which is managed by Joy&amp;#39;s older half-sister Peggy, with whom she has somewhat of a strained relationship, and for which Joy does the books. Sharon, Rudy&amp;#39;s latest girlfriend who has just dumped him, drops him off on Joy&amp;#39;s doorstep, making Joy&amp;#39;s home life even more complicated as Rudy does not get along with either Terry or Tony. Joy begins to feel buried by her life, in the process her childhood dream of making things seemingly getting farther and farther away. As such, Joy decides to make some changes in her life, and expects the unquestioning practical support of her family. Those changes include manufacturing a new product of her design; what she chooses this time around being a self-wringing mop. That support also includes being able to pitch the idea to Rudy&amp;#39;s current wealthy girlfriend, Trudy. Even if she does get to the manufacturing stage, Joy will have to battle the narrow minds of business executives in marketing her product, that is unless she can find a way to get into the homes of the American public in one fell swoop. But nothing is a done deal until the consumer forks out his/her hard earned money for the product and all the legal issues are dealt with. Joy has to decide if she will &amp;#39;pick up the gun&amp;#39; as Trudy asked in their initial investment meeting in dealing with an especially troublesome legal issue.","country":"USA","language":"English, Spanish, French","imdbid":"tt2446980"},"mgname":["Dramas based on real life","Biographical Dramas","Comedies","Dramas"],"Genreid":["3653","3179","6548","5763"],"people":[{"actor":["Jennifer Lawrence","Edgar Ramirez","Bradley Cooper","Robert De Niro","Susan Lucci","Isabella Rossellini","Virginia Madsen","Diane Ladd","Elisabeth Rohm","Dascha Polanco"]},{"creator":["David O.
