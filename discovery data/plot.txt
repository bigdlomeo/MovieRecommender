Outwardly Charles built it so that they can spend time there to reconnect as a family, but they all know that he really built it to support the business. They as a family have long not been happy, as workaholic Charles is always concerned the company is close to folding, especially if he doesn&amp;#39;t keep an eye on matters, while Judith feels like he treats their entire family as second priority to the work and the associated money and material wealth. They make it to the cabin just before a major snowstorm hits the area. They receive a surprise knock on their door from the Tuckers - parents Joe and Amy, and their two children, fifteen year old Robbie and fourteen year old Lucie - who ran off the road in their van on their way to a day ski trip, they who need shelter until the storm blows over. Unlike the Montgomerys, the Tuckers are a loving, happy family, who support each other as a family unit. The Montgomerys and the Tuckers do bond during their confined time together, but the sheer presence of the Tuckers may not be enough in and of itself to demonstrate to the Montgomerys what they need to do to avert the break-up of their family.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt4480940"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Family Dramas","Children & Family Films","Family Features"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","31901","783","51056"],"people":[{"actor":["Catherine Lough Haggquist","Nick Purcha","Colin Lawrence","Lizzie Boys","Kolton Stewart","Chris Potter","Jaeda Lily  Miller","Kristy Swanson"]},{"creator":["Kenneth Atchity","Chi-Li Wong","Julie Brazier","Rexanne Becnel"]},{"director":["George Erschbamer"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Thomas Gates, Ben&amp;#39;s great-grandfather, is mentioned on the page. It shows that Ben&amp;#39;s great-grandfather was a co-conspirator in Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s murder. When doing more research, the conspiracy takes Ben, Abigail Chase, and Riley Poole to Buckingham Palace (which they break into). They discover a plank that has early Native American writing on it. The plank has only one symbol that Patrick Gates can identify. The symbol is Cibola (see-bowl-uh) meaning the City of Gold. In order to define the rest they have to go to Ben&amp;#39;s mother, Patrick&amp;#39;s divorced wife. After 32 years it brings back old arguments. After that the other clue is in the President&amp;#39;s desk in the Oval Office in the White House (which Ben and Abigail sneak into) to discover that the clue lies in The President&amp;#39;s Book. But in order to see the book, their choice is either get elected president or kidnap the President of the United States. Which do they choose? It&amp;#39;s obvious. With Wilkinson close on their tail, they find the book in the Library of Congress. The conspiracy then crosses to Mount Rushmore where the clue was on the hills, but (according to the Book) President Calvin Coolidge had the faces carved in so no one can find the City of Gold. When they get there they find out that they must work with Wilkinson since he has some clues of his own. Who will claim Cibola? And will the name of Gates be known as murder?","country":"USA","language":"English, French","imdbid":"tt0465234"},"mgname":["Family Features","Action Thrillers","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Action & Adventure","Adventures"],"Genreid":["51056","43048","783","561","1365","7442"],"people":[{"actor":["Nicolas Cage","Justin Bartha","Diane Kruger","Jon Voight","Albert Hall","Emerson Brooks","Michael Stone Forrest","Ty Burrell","Christian Camargo","Demetri Goritsas","Harvey Keitel","Peter Woodward","Alicia Leigh Willis","Helen Mirren","Natalie Dreyfuss","David Ury","Michael Maize","Susan Beresford","Emily Joyce","Zachary Gordon","Brent Briscoe","Alicia Coppola","Larry Cedar","Richard Cutting","Timothy V.

Braddock--a.k.a. the Cinderella Man--was to become one of the most surprising sports legends in history. By the early 1930s, the impoverished ex-prizefighter was seemingly as broken-down, beaten-up and out-of-luck as much of the rest of the American populace who had hit rock bottom. His career appeared to be finished, he was unable to pay the bills, the only thing that mattered to him--his family--was in danger, and he was even forced to go on Public Relief. But deep inside, Jim Braddock never relinquished his determination. Driven by love, honor and an incredible dose the ones who are do of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true.

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

Participants are flown to Los Angeles first class, paid $1,500, and put up for four nights in a luxury hotel. Suitable participants are deemed to be younger, muscular males. The event is held on a monthly basis. In contacting the organizers, US-based Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media, via their popular Facebook to arrange for an interview, David receives a return message from one of their representatives, Debbie J. Kuhn, declining the offer, the message a homophobic rant largely against David. In that message, Debbie asserts that the competition is wholly a heterosexual athletic activity, she who does not appreciate what will be David&amp;#39;s assumed gay bent on the story as a homosexual himself (which David does not state he is or isn&amp;#39;t in his request). David finds the message all the more odd as the activity as it appears in the videos has an undeniable gay vibe. What is even more odd is that Debbie on behalf of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien, continually emails David over the following weeks expounding on the themes in the original message. At this time, David&amp;#39;s friend, Dylan Reeve, enters the fray, acting initially as a researcher for David, and then eventually as co-filmmaker for a documentary on the subject. However, the documentary eventually morphs from the sport of competitive endurance tickling into the mysterious world of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien and Debbie Kuhn, especially: as they seem to have unlimited resources both to hold the events and to conduct their online harassment they learn not only of David, but of former associates who now seem to want to distance themselves from the &amp;#39;sport&amp;#39; and Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media; as Jane and Debbie initiate legal action and threaten even more legal action, and issue general threats time and time against David and Dylan not only for this unauthorized documentary but for their activities toward Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media as a whole; and as no one seems to know who Debbie or Jane are, even the people that work for them, or what their end goal is. The story takes a further twist when David and Dylan learn there truly is a tickling sexual fetish subculture, one within that community, Richard Ivey, who willingly talks to David and who remembers someone else online decades ago within the community with a similar M.O. to Debbie and Jane.","country":"New Zealand","language":"English","imdbid":"tt5278506"},"mgname":["Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Dylan Reeve","David Farrier","David Starr","Hal Karp"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["David Farrier","Dylan Reeve"]}],"country":[]}}

And that is exactly what happens to firefighter Jeff Elliott and his wife Ruth who are living their dream in the golden Midwest; high school sweethearts, married with two beautiful and healthy children, family farm, horses, sports, church groups, the whole American Dream come true. And one winters day, teenage son Eric &amp;#39;Hoovey&amp;#39; Elliott collapses at high school basketball practice, is rushed to the hospital, and the doctors find a tumor the size of an orange at the base of his brain. They&amp;#39;re down to hours-if surgery that risks the boy&amp;#39;s ability to walk, talk, and perhaps even survive is not performed immediately, Hoovey&amp;#39;s young life will end before it truly even begins. In a grueling 8-hour procedure, the tumor is removed. And he survives. But for the Elliott family, life and dreams will never be the same. Hoovey has to teach himself to walk again, to read again, to even see straight with two unbalanced eyes, covered one at a time by an eye patch. Forget ever stepping on a basketball court - the risk of receiving a fatal blow to the spot on his head is just too great. As the unpaid medical bills mount, Jeff&amp;#39;s firefighting salary isn&amp;#39;t enough, the family is swimming in crippling debt seemingly overnight, everything he and Ruth have built in their life dream of two kids is at stake. Hoovey&amp;#39;s teenage sister Jen feels alone and nearly forgotten in the most important time of her life. And as Hoovey realizes his one dream in life-playing this game-is gone, too, he sinks into a deep sadness. This is a family at risk. With no-one to turn to, but themselves and their God. HOOVEY is the true and inspiring story of the Elliott family, who refused to surrender, instead turning to one another and their faith in the worst of circumstances, to rebuild their lives, their boy, and their dreams... together. Step by grueling step, with faith, love, and the tireless work of a mother and father to save their family, their farm, their dream, Hoovey learns to walk again. To read again. To dribble and shoot a basketball again. And yes, to dream again himself. Then stepping out in his faith, back onto the hard court, to live that dream of playing this game once more...","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2828884"},"mgname":["Faith & Spirituality","Faith & Spirituality Films","Tearjerkers","Dramas"],"Genreid":["26835","52804","6384","5763"],"people":[{"actor":["Alexandria Deberry","Stephen Baldwin","Lauren Holly","Cody Linley","Glenn Morshower","Charles Robinson","Brandon Mychal Smith","Patrick Warburton","Alyson Stoner"]},{"creator":["Howard Klausner"]},{"director":["Sean McNamara"]}],"country":[]}}

Simon has finally been able to get Carli D&amp;#39;Amato, who he has been in love with since they were children, to be his girlfriend. Largely because they will be going away to different schools in the fall, Carli breaks up with him. To get Simon&amp;#39;s singularly focused mind off Carli, his three best mates decide to take him on vacation for two weeks to get some sun, sand and girls before they move onto the next chapter of their lives in the fall. Neil makes the decision for them to go to Malia on the isle of Crete, a popular summer tourist destination for many a Brit. Jay, with inheritance money in hand, believes he can have the pick of any girl he wants. Neil has to decide what constitutes not cheating on his girlfriend, Nicole. Will wants to add a bit of culture into the vacation. And Simon still pines for Carli, getting her off his mind being more difficult when he learns why Neil chose Malia. What starts off as a disastrous vacation has the potential to pick up when they meet fellow Brits Alison, Lucy, Jane and Lisa, who pair up with Will, Simon, Jay and Neil respectively, and with who they hang, out of circumstance, for much of their time in Malia. Will the virgin, who generally makes Alison laugh, has no chance with her as she is far out of his league, and as she is already in a serious relationship with a Greek waiter named Nicos. Jay is ashamed to be seen with self-assured Jane, because she is overweight. Neil treats Lisa like any other female with who he wants to have non-cheating &amp;#39;sex&amp;#39;.

The grandson is sure he won&amp;#39;t like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and &amp;#39;no kissing&amp;#39;. But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of &amp;#39;as you wish&amp;#39; to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0093779"},"mgname":["Family Features","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Cult Comedies","Fantasy","Romantic Favourites","Family Comedies","Romantic Comedies","Cult Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Family Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Comedies","Adventures","Action & Adventure","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["51056","1492","9434","9744","502675","52847","5475","4734","52849","783","561","6548","7442","1365","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Cary Elwes","Peter Cook","Peter Falk","Christopher Guest","Andre the Giant","Mandy Patinkin","Wallace Shawn","Fred Savage","Robin Wright","Chris Sarandon","Billy Crystal"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Rob Reiner"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"}]}}

She is just like Drew Boley was when he first arrived in Hollywood, he, now the Hollywood veteran, who works as a bar back at the Bourbon Club, known as the center of the rock scene in town and the place where many of the biggest acts in rock got their big break. The two meet as Drew helps Sherrie with a situation when she first arrives in town. Despite Dennis Dupree, the Bourbon&amp;#39;s owner/manager, not liking to hire people like Drew or Sherrie - someone who has musical aspirations - as service staff, Drew is able to convince Dennis and his assistant Lonny to hire Sherrie as a server, Drew and Sherrie who have a blossoming mutual attraction. Dennis and Lonny, who are having financial difficulties, are able to convince rock star Stacee Jaxx, the perpetually stoned front man for the band Arsenal who got his first break performing at the Bourbon, to perform for free at a benefit concert at the club. Rumors are that Stacee is leaving Arsenal after their next gig to go solo, Rolling Stones reporter Constance Sack who wants to get the true story as to the reason. Another problem for the Bourbon is that Mayor Mike Whitmore is taking a tough stance on what he sees as bad societal influences like rock music. His Christian fundamentalist wife Patricia Whitmore is leading the on the ground campaign in this area, she who is determined to shut down the Bourbon.

His mentor still believes in him and urges him to go to Italy to take an exorcism course hoping that he it would strengthen his faith in Christianity. In Italy he attends a session from Father Xavier who soon becomes aware of his skepticism. As a result he sends him to an eminent Jesuit exorcist, Father Lucas, whose ways though questionable are quite effective. He witnesses the exorcism of a sixteen year old girl but still seems unconvinced. Father Lucas explains to him that it takes multiple sessions over a long stretch of time to completely free a victim from the demon. Despite witnessing some supernatural occurrences during the aforesaid exorcism, Michael is as skeptical as ever. After the second exorcism, the girls condition becomes quite critical as she is moved to a hospital. She soon dies and the demon finds a new victim. As the moment of reckoning draws near, Micheal may be the only hope left but first he must overcome his own doubts and apprehensions in order to fight and destroy the ominous forces.","country":"USA, Hungary, Italy","language":"English, Welsh, Italian, Latin, Russian, Hungarian","imdbid":"tt1161864"},"mgname":["Horror Movies","Thrillers"],"Genreid":["8711","8933"],"people":[{"actor":["Rutger Hauer","Anthony Hopkins","Alice Braga","Colin O&amp;#39;Donoghue","Maria Grazia Cucinotta","Ciaran Hinds","Marta Gastini","Arianna Veronesi","Toby Jones","Chris Marquette","Colin ODonoghue"]},{"creator":["Michael Petroni","Matt Baglio"]},{"director":["Mikael Hafstrom"]}],"country":[{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["English","French","Dutch"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"France ","ccode":"fr","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["English","French"],"cid":"45","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Portugal ","ccode":"pt","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-08","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Portuguese"],"cid":"268","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Spain ","ccode":"es","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","European Spanish"],"subs":["English","European Spanish"],"cid":"270","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-03","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["English","French"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

Two decades pass and Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has the world at his feet-or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), to help with her family troubles.","country":"USA, Australia, UK","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1077368"},"mgname":["International Comedies","Comedies","International Movies"],"Genreid":["852492","6548","78367"],"people":[{"actor":["Chloe Grace Moretz","Helena Bonham Carter","Michelle Pfeiffer","Johnny Depp","Bella Heathcote","Eva Green","Gulliver McGrath","Jonny Lee Miller","Christopher Lee","Jackie Earle Haley","Ray Shirley"]},{"creator":["Seth Grahame-Smith","John August","Dan Curtis"]},{"director":["Tim Burton"]}],"country":[{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2017-09-23","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["English","Polish"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Portugal ","ccode":"pt","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Portuguese"],"cid":"268","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["English","Russian"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2016-02-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Spain ","ccode":"es","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","European Spanish"],"subs":["English","European Spanish"],"cid":"270","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

Using cybernetic implants, the Agency uses a process called &amp;#39;conditioning&amp;#39; to turn orphaned children into emotionless killing machines with hardly any memories, no human comfort and worst of all, no free will. The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta&amp;#39;s handler doesn&amp;#39;t like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life. Because if they don&amp;#39;t play by the agency&amp;#39;s rules...they will die.","country":"Japan","language":"Japanese, English","imdbid":"tt0476042"},"mgname":["Anime Series","TV Shows"],"Genreid":["6721","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Luci Christian","Alese Johnson","Kanako Mitsuhashi","Eriko Hirata","Kana Hanazawa","Atsuko Enomoto","Masashi Ebara","Norihiro Inoe","Monica Rial","Anri Shiono","Rie Nakagawa","Daisuke Kishio","Yuka Nanri","Eri Sendai","Hidenobu Kiuchi","Kana Akutsu","Ami Koshimizu","Hiroki Yasumoto","Masami Iwasaki","Mike McFarland","Norihiro Inoue","Jerry Jewell","Caitlin Glass","Hitomi Terakado","Laura Bailey","Mitsuru Miyamoto","Stephanie Young","Risa Mizuno","John Burgmeier","Kazuki Yao","Yuji Ueda","Hiroshi Yanaka","Takehito Koyasu","Masaya Matsukaze","Kozo Mito","Yuuka Nanri","Kenyu Horiuchi"]},{"creator":["Yu Aida"]},{"director":[]}],"country":[]}}

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The Google DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history. Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Cambridge, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and, ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?","country":"USA","language":"English, Korean","imdbid":"tt6700846"},"mgname":["Documentaries","Science & Technology Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839","49110"],"people":[{"actor":["Ioannis Antonoglou","Lucas Baker","Nick Bostrom","Yoo Changhyuk"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Greg Kohs"]}],"country":[]}}

Helping him piece things together is his father-in-law, Sheriff Hank Larsson. The investigation will lead them to a colorful cast of characters that includes Karl Weathers, the town lawyer of Luverne, Minnesota. A Korean War vet, Karl is a flowery drunk blessed with the gift of gab and the eloquence of a true con artist. Joe Bulo, the front man for the northern expansion of a Kansas City crime syndicate. The new face of corporate crime, Joe&amp;#39;s bringing a Walmart mentality to small town America. His number two is Mike Milligan. Part enforcer, part detective, Mike is always smiling - but the joke is usually on you. Bulo and his crew have their sights set on the Gerhardt crime family in Fargo, currently led by matriarch Floyd Gerhardt. With her husband at death&amp;#39;s door, Floyd takes over the family business, frustrating her eldest son, Dodd Gerhardt. An impatient hothead with a cruel streak to match his ambitions, Dodd can&amp;#39;t wait for both his parents to die so he can take over and expand their business from kingdom to empire. Bear Gerhardt is the middle son, an intimidatingly large man who, although inarticulate, is the most decent of his clan. Rye Gerhardt, the youngest of the Gerhardt clan, views himself as a big shot, but in reality he&amp;#39;s just a small dog who barks big.","country":"USA","language":"English, German, Korean, Spanish, American Sign Language, French, Russian, Hebrew","imdbid":"tt2802850"},"mgname":["TV Comedies","TV Thrillers","US TV Programmes","TV Programmes"],"Genreid":["10375","89811","72404","83"],"people":[{"actor":["Billy Bob Thornton","Colin Hanks","Martin Freeman","Patrick Wilson","Joey King","Jean Smart","Michael Stuhlbarg","Bob Odenkirk","Jeffrey Donovan","Ted Danson","Cristin Milioti","Allison Tolman","Bokeem Woodbine","David Thewlis","Mary Elizabeth Winstead","Kirsten Dunst","Ewan McGregor","Keith Carradine","Carrie Coon","Jesse Plemons"]},{"creator":["Noah Hawley"]},{"director":[]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["French","Dutch"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2017-12-15","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2017-10-17","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["German","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["Arabic","German","English","French","Dutch"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"France ","ccode":"fr","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["French"],"cid":"45","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2019-03-03","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["German","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["German","Greek","English","French"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2016-05-15","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2018-04-10","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2018-09-15","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Lithuania ","ccode":"lt","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2016-05-15","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"357","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-15","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2019-02-27","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-14","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["German","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["German","French"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2019-10-17","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"3 seasons","new":"2015-04-15","expires":"","seasondet":["1(10)","2(10)","3(10)"],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

When an alien Seeker captures a girl named Melanie and puts a Wanderer in her body, she hopes to find out where the remaining humans are gathered, but Melanie, a strong fighter able to converse with the alien in her commandeered body, convinces the Wanderer to say nothing. Disappointed by the lack of progress (though suspecting an empathy for the human), the Seeker informs the Wanderer that she&amp;#39;ll be removed and placed in a new host while she herself will enter Melanie. With human lives at risk, Melanie convinces Wanderer to run away and hide out with the humans, but finding them doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;ll allow an alien presence among them. Jared (Melanie&amp;#39;s boyfriend) wants her dead, but Jeb (Melanie&amp;#39;s uncle) wants to wait, and Ian, tasked with guarding her, finds himself siding with Jeb. As Ian begins to fall for Melanie, a strange love triangle develops, with Ian wanting Wanderer (inhabiting Melanie&amp;#39;s body), Jared wanting Melanie (imprisoned inside her own body), and no one knowing any way to separate the two without killing both.","country":"USA, Switzerland","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1517260"},"mgname":["Sci-Fi Dramas","Dramas","Romantic Dramas","Thrillers","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Sci-Fi Thrillers","Alien Sci-Fi","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature"],"Genreid":["3916","5763","1255","8933","1492","11014","3327","4961","8883","12994"],"people":[{"actor":["Shyaam Karra","Brent Wendell Williams","Jhil McEntyre","Jake Abel","Scott Lawrence","Chandler Canterbury","Bokeem Woodbine","Diane Kruger","William Hurt","David House","Max Irons","Saoirse Ronan","Boyd Holbrook","Frances Fisher","Marcus Lyle Brown"]},{"creator":["Andrew Niccol","Stephenie Meyer"]},{"director":["Andrew Niccol"]}],"country":[{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Czech","English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"","new":"2018-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Czech","English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-25","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"}]}}

Regardless, he is well liked by most of the other employees. He used to be hard working, when he was developing a dot com, but he lost all his and his grandmother&amp;#39;s money in the process. As such, he decided not to take any risks in life while he now lives with her so as to provide her with what he considers at least a more reliable life. On the other extreme is Vince Downey, who lords an air of superiority over his fellow employees as the store&amp;#39;s head cashier. He lives to be the store&amp;#39;s best employee solely so that he can be named Employee of the Month, which he has been named seventeen months in a row. If he is named Employee of the Month for a record eighteenth time in a row, he will be rewarded with entrance into the corporation&amp;#39;s management track program and a new car. Zack decides he wants to break Vince&amp;#39;s streak if only because he reads in the employment record of recent transfer, the pretty Amy Renfro, that she had a thing at her previous store for men who have been named Employee of the Month. Zack finds that working toward being Employee of the Month is not as easy as he thought, especially as Vince will not relinquish the title and all its perks without a fight, dirty or not.

At the center of it all is the rise, fall and redemption of Freeway Rick Ross, a street hustler who became the King of Crack, and journalist Gary Webb, who broke the story of the CIA&amp;#39;s complicity in the drug war. Featuring exclusive interviews with Freeway Rick Ross, not to be confused with the rapper who took his name Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb, his source Coral Baca, and wife Susan Webb former Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff Roberto Juarez drug trafficker Julio Zavala and many more. The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection.

Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel&amp;#39;s heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her than he is in selling, his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald&amp;#39;s Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, it owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray&amp;#39;s customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick&amp;#39;s initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray&amp;#39;s experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for &amp;#39;his&amp;#39; business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities.","country":"USA","language":"English, Yiddish","imdbid":"tt4276820"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on real life"],"Genreid":["5763","3653"],"people":[{"actor":["Linda Cardellini","Patrick Wilson","Laura Dern","Nick Offerman","B.J.

The parents have passed their ideals to their children, namely socialism (in its various forms) and survivalism. With the former, Ben considers most of western society as being fascist, especially corporate America. With the latter, he figures that no one will or should be there for you, so you better learn how to take care of yourself in all its aspects. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training, know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains and even fractures, and know how to hunt, forage and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie&amp;#39;s health. Formerly a lawyer, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben figures that this disorder started with her post-partum depression with Bo. Even with this lifestyle, Leslie&amp;#39;s condition has become progressively worse. Despite not believing in western medicine, Ben, to deal with the illness, has sent Leslie to hospital, one close to Ben&amp;#39;s sister, Harper, in Sacramento so that there can be family close by. While in hospital, Leslie is able to commit suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie&amp;#39;s act brings out a battle between Ben, and Leslie&amp;#39;s father, Jack Bertrang, a wealthy Christian, who not only blames Ben for what happened to Leslie, but believes what he is doing to the children can legally be considered abuse. To be held in their church in New Mexico, Jack takes over the funeral arrangements to his and his complacent wife Abby&amp;#39;s Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie&amp;#39;s wishes, she who believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, he and the children believe it is the latest of their missions to rescue Leslie to honor her last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophies. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long seated issues within the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he who may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.","country":"USA","language":"English, Esperanto","imdbid":"tt3553976"},"mgname":["Independent Comedies","Cannes Film Festival Award-winning Movies","Award-winning Movies","Comedies","Independent Movies"],"Genreid":["4195","846810","89844","6548","7077"],"people":[{"actor":["Nicholas Hamilton","Ann Dowd","Missi Pyle","Steve Zahn","Samantha Isler","George MacKay","Trin Miller","Annalise Basso","Kathryn Hahn","Frank Langella","Erin Moriarty","Viggo Mortensen","Charlie Shotwell","Shree Crooks"]},{"creator":["Matt Ross"]},{"director":["Matt Ross"]}],"country":[{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"}]}}

He makes a hue and cry in the village saying God made an appearance for him. Anna (Dilip Prabhavalkar), most respected figure of Mangrul, advises him against announcing such personal matter as it&amp;#39;s a question of faith. However, it is too late as a journalist (Kishor Kadam) sensationalizes the news about Lord Dattatrey making an appearance in Mangrul. There is now a demand for a Dattatrey temple. Bhau (Nana Patekar), a political activist, doesn&amp;#39;t approve it as he wants the funds to be used for better purposes but he seems helpless. The temple is built and the village becomes a holy place. Mangrul goes through a 360 degree change due to commercialization but nobody is complaining except Anna. Soon, blinded by the commercial progress, God is forgotten. Every village has a right to progress commercially but how ethical it is to use a temple and its God to achieve it? The question is raised by Writer Girish Kulkarni &amp; Director Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni&amp;#39;s latest offering &amp;#39;Deool&amp;#39;, without being judgemental.

Rebecca&amp;#39;s 11th birthday is here, and she wants the gift she wants every year, a cat. Tom hates cats, but he is without a gift and time is running out. His GPS directs him to a mystical pet store brimming with odd and exotic cats- where the store&amp;#39;s eccentric owner- Felix Perkins (Christopher Walken), presents him with a majestic tomcat, named Mr. Fuzzypants. En route to present his daughter with her dream pet, a bizarre turn of events finds Tom trapped inside the body of Mr. Fuzzypants. Adopted by his own family, he begins to experience what life is truly like for the family pet, and as a cat, Tom begins to see his family and his life through a new and unexpected perspective. Meanwhile, his family adjusts to life with an odd and stubborn cat, and his son David (Robbie Amell), steps up in ways Tom never expected. If any hope exists of returning to his family as the husband and father they deserve, Tom will have to learn why he has been placed in this peculiar situation and the great lengths he must go to earn back his human existence.","country":"France, China, Canada","language":"English","imdbid":"tt4383594"},"mgname":["Family Comedies","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Family Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","Children & Family Films","Comedies","Family Features"],"Genreid":["52847","1492","52849","9744","783","6548","51056"],"people":[{"actor":["Christopher Walken","Teddy Sears","Cheryl Hines","Talitha Bateman","Malina Weissman","Robbie Amell","Jennifer Garner","Mark Consuelos","Kevin Spacey","Talitha Eliana Bateman"]},{"creator":["Gwyn Lurie","Matt Allen","Caleb Wilson","Dan Antoniazzi","Ben Shiffrin"]},{"director":["Barry Sonnenfeld"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2018-12-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2018-12-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-03","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["Czech","English [Original]","Slovak"],"subs":["Czech"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"France ","ccode":"fr","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-03","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","French"],"subs":["French"],"cid":"45","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2019-08-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2018-12-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2019-04-05","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Dutch"],"subs":["Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Polish"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2019-01-08","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["Czech","English [Original]","Slovak"],"subs":["Czech"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Dutch"],"subs":["Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-31","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

A man who lives for his religion, soaked in years of ancient traditions, values and morals. He is a strict, yet lovable man. As any real priest would, Chaturvedi believes he is a disciple of God on this earth to spread God&amp;#39;s message and love as he goes about his rigidly ritualistic world of pooja&amp;#39;s and teachings. One day his daughter brings home an infant (Krish Parekh) and the mother of the infant has disappeared and cannot be found nowhere. Pandit Chaturvedi is hesitant to have the child around the house at first, and when it&amp;#39;s confirmed that the child has been abandoned, he then makes the decision that the child will be raised in the local orphanage. However the Pandit&amp;#39;s wife Parvati (Supriya Pathak Kapur) has by now developed a soft spot for the young child and requests her husband if they can keep and raise the child if as their own. Hesitant at first, the priest reluctantly agrees as his wife lies to him that the baby is the son of a Brahmin. Slowly, the child wins over everyone hearts in the house including Pandit Chaturvedi who finds a son, a disciple and a best friend in the child. The story takes a turn when the baby&amp;#39;s mother returns to claim him back, and much to the shock of Pandit Chaturvedi, the lady is a Muslim. The child who they&amp;#39;d fondly named Karthik is in fact Mustafa. Pandit Chaturvedi is in a state of shock and utter despair as he feels he has done the biggest sin of his life and feel as if he has betrayed his religion and more-so God. In a state of recluse and regret, Pandit Chaturvedi decides to take a series of different vows and &amp;#39;vraths&amp;#39; to clear his conscience. However whilst his mind is telling him he has done a grave sin, his heart sorely misses his little son, and the words &amp;#39;babuji&amp;#39; echo in every corridor of the house. In a series of events, riots break out in the city of Varanasi, Mustafa&amp;#39;s mum begs and pleads the Pandit and his family to take back the little boy as he is much safer with them. However the doors of the house are closed for the little boy. What follows next can only be only described as a journey as Pandit Chaturvedi defies what he has believed his entire life if &amp;#39;religion&amp;#39; and listens to his inner conscience in the rousing finale.","country":"India","language":"Hindi","imdbid":"tt1047459"},"mgname":["International Films","International Dramas","Indian Films","Bollywood Films","Dramas","Musicals"],"Genreid":["78367","852493","10463","5480","5763","13335"],"people":[{"actor":["Pankaj Kapur","Suruchi Aulakh","K.K.

Years pass by, and Charu is busy engrossed in treating patients, leaving Maya alone to ponder her own fate and life. And it is not long before a young man named Rudra enters her life, and an affair follows.

She longs for more than bodily needs, and it is perhaps this that leads to her sudden death, leaving two investigators to probe who or what really killed Maya.","country":"France, UK,

It feels like being in a deserted island, which was once your beautiful abode, now covered with carnivorous hedges pricking and luring. Colour of the sky at sunset is not soothing anymore but seems like covered in blood, rustling of leave is not peaceful but an indication of someone coming to chain you, the sand is no more soft and relaxing but a quicksand pulling you down and the chirping of birds becomes a screech of an eagle. You are no more yourself but a stranger you detest. How can you reason out what has happened to you and rationalize to live with it? Why will you remain in the social boundaries and accept the way of life after being torn apart. Maroon is a story of a man, creative writing professor in a university in Dehradun, betrayed by his loving wife, a music teacher in a school, struggles to live in humiliation. His deep pain makes him take a masochistic step which results in deep guilt and fear. In his attempt to cope up he becomes delusional and his interaction with the outside world gradually enters a different plane of reality and he becomes psychologically impaired.","country":"India","language":"Hindi","imdbid":"tt6118058"},"mgname":["International Dramas","Thrillers","International Thrillers","Psychological Thrillers","International

We open the film with a ship finding the craft with our original characters in it, Richard and Emmeline dead and Paddy alive. Established in the first film, the only word Paddy ever says is &amp;#39;Richard&amp;#39;, so the crew assumes Richard is the infant&amp;#39;s name. Taken in by Sarah, a widow with an infant baby girl Lilli, Richard (Paddy) is cared for in a return to civilization. Struck by cholera, the crew of the ship start to die and the captain sets Sarah, Richard, Lilli and a healthy crew member on a lifeboat in an attempt to preserve their lives. With water and food running short, the crew member escorting Sarah and the children becomes dangerous, so Sarah takes the only course of action she feels suitable to preserve the children: she strikes him and throws him overboard. Taking control of the small craft, she eventually guides them back to the island of the first film. The infant Richard, recognizing where he is, finds his home and is very upset not to find his parents. Fixing up the hut and settling in the children, Sarah begins their life on the island, slowly teaching the children survival tools, as well as schooling them as though they were in school, and teaching them slowly about the facts of life, including Lilli&amp;#39;s eventual growth to womanhood. When Sarah dies from pneumonia, she leaves the children far more prepared than Richard and Emmeline in the first film. Years later as the children grow into adulthood, the film skims the same themes as the first of their developing relationship, and introduces the characters to civilization when a ship, low on fresh water, stops on their island and offers to take them home. After a confrontation with one of the crew and the captain&amp;#39;s daughter, Lilli finds herself pregnant and they decide to stay, as they feel the civilization the visitors have to offer will not compare to the life they lead on the island.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0102782"},"mgname":["Romantic Films","Action & Adventure","Romantic Films based on a book","Adventures","Dramas","Romantic Dramas","Dramas based on a book"],"Genreid":["8883","1365","3830","7442","5763","1255","4961"],"people":[{"actor":["Lisa Pelikan","Peter Hehir","Nana Coburn","Courtney Barilla","Brian Krause","Milla Jovovich","Alexander Petersons","Brian Blain","Garette Ratliff Henson"]},{"creator":["Henry De Vere Stacpoole","Leslie Stevens"]},{"director":["William A.

And that is exactly what happens to firefighter Jeff Elliott and his wife Ruth who are living their dream in the golden Midwest; high school sweethearts, married with two beautiful and healthy children, family farm, horses, sports, church groups, the whole American Dream come true. And one winters day, teenage son Eric &amp;#39;Hoovey&amp;#39; Elliott collapses at high school basketball practice, is rushed to the hospital, and the doctors find a tumor the size of an orange at the base of his brain. They&amp;#39;re down to hours-if surgery that risks the boy&amp;#39;s ability to walk, talk, and perhaps even survive is not performed immediately, Hoovey&amp;#39;s young life will end before it truly even begins. In a grueling 8-hour procedure, the tumor is removed. And he survives. But for the Elliott family, life and dreams will never be the same. Hoovey has to teach himself to walk again, to read again, to even see straight with two unbalanced eyes, covered one at a time by an eye patch. Forget ever stepping on a basketball court - the risk of receiving a fatal blow to the spot on his head is just too great. As the unpaid medical bills mount, Jeff&amp;#39;s firefighting salary isn&amp;#39;t enough, the family is swimming in crippling debt seemingly overnight, everything he and Ruth have built in their life dream of two kids is at stake. Hoovey&amp;#39;s teenage sister Jen feels alone and nearly forgotten in the most important time of her life. And as Hoovey realizes his one dream in life-playing this game-is gone, too, he sinks into a deep sadness. This is a family at risk. With no-one to turn to, but themselves and their God. HOOVEY is the true and inspiring story of the Elliott family, who refused to surrender, instead turning to one another and their faith in the worst of circumstances, to rebuild their lives, their boy, and their dreams... together. Step by grueling step, with faith, love, and the tireless work of a mother and father to save their family, their farm, their dream, Hoovey learns to walk again. To read again. To dribble and shoot a basketball again. And yes, to dream again himself. Then stepping out in his faith, back onto the hard court, to live that dream of playing this game once more...","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2828884"},"mgname":["Faith & Spirituality","Faith & Spirituality Films","Tearjerkers","Dramas"],"Genreid":["26835","52804","6384","5763"],"people":[{"actor":["Alexandria Deberry","Stephen Baldwin","Lauren Holly","Cody Linley","Glenn Morshower","Charles Robinson","Brandon Mychal Smith","Patrick Warburton","Alyson Stoner"]},{"creator":["Howard Klausner"]},{"director":["Sean McNamara"]}],"country":[]}}

He learns from his dim-witted best friend, Cody, a porcupine and street-con, that while he was in lock-up, the entire forest was picked clean by The A.C.O.R.N.S. Institute (Alternative Cosmetic Oils for Regenerative Natural Skin-care). No acorn was left behind. With winter just around the corner, it&amp;#39;s a potentially devastating blow to all forest critters. So, Frankie has no choice but to bust into the brand new, state-of-the-art, rodent-proof A.C.O.R.N.S. Processing Plant and take back all of the acorns! Though a seemingly impossible heist, success would not only save the lives of his forest friends, but it would also give Frankie a chance to win back the love of his life, Lola, a local &amp;#39;show squirrel.&amp;#39; Sadly, Lola has been burnt by too many of Frankie&amp;#39;s false promises in the past. With the support of Frankie&amp;#39;s old mentor, Mr. Bellwood, a wealthy badger, Frankie and Cody assemble a team of top notch &amp;#39;crackers&amp;#39; from all over the forest, including: a bat named Fly Boy, a top notch munitions expert; Raitch, a computer hacking albino snake, who never allows her lack of appendages to get in the way; Edsy a tiny &amp;#39;family frog,&amp;#39; whose ability to freeze himself solid for days on end without harm is invaluable; a germophobic French rat named Liam, who can collapse his skeleton to get into any space; Chinese father-daughter pangolins named Pango and Lin, the best diggers in the forest; and Bellwood&amp;#39;s hedgehog butler, Oscar who knows how to get his hands on anything the crew needs. With winter knocking at their door, Frankie and his crew have only three days to prepare and execute this unprecedented heist. When they learn that the processing of their forest&amp;#39;s acorns has been pushed up a day, Lola&amp;#39;s refusal to participate leaves Frankie and his crew one critter short. With everything on the line, Frankie and his crew of Animal Crackerz set out to pull off the biggest heist in animal history!","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2097333"},"mgname":["Family Animation","Films for ages 2 to 4","Films for ages 5 to 7","Family Comedies","Children & Family Films"],"Genreid":["58879","6218","5455","52847","783"],"people":[{"actor":["John Cleese","Samantha Bee","Will Forte","Victoria Justice","John Leguizamo","Jason Jones"]},{"creator":["Lenore Venokur"]},{"director":["Ross Venokur"]}],"country":[{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2019-11-09","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["Polish"],"subs":"","cid":"392","islive":"yes"}]}}

But things are not so rosy as they look: on a personal level, their relationships have been cooling down while they suffer from not having children. On a professional plane, things have deteriorated as well. Josh, who is also a documentary filmmaker like his father-in-law, has lost inspiration: he has been grappling with his last movie for eight years now without being able to complete it. To be true, Josh goes nowhere and his marriage is on the rocks. Things start changing when Josh and Cornelia meet another married pair: Jamie and Darby, a generation younger, express their admiration for Josh (Jamie wishing to become a documentary filmmaker himself). Plus, they are much cooler, smarter and more uninhibited than the two forty-odds. Could they help Josh and Cornelia to revive their couple?

Eventually, James will find himself in the epicentre of the evil activity, trapped inside the very house where his sister disappeared, unaware of the fact that, once more, the witch will demand her sacrifice.","country":"Canada, USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1540011"},"mgname":["Supernatural Horror Films","Thrillers","Horror Films","Supernatural Thrillers"],"Genreid":["42023","8933","8711","11140"],"people":[{"actor":["Callie Hernandez","Wes Robinson","Corbin Reid","Valorie Curry","Brandon Scott","James Allen McCune"]},{"creator":["Simon Barrett"]},{"director":["Adam Wingard"]}],"country":[{"country":"Argentina ","ccode":"ar","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"21","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Spanish","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-01-03","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Canadian French"],"subs":["English","Canadian French"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2020-02-03","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Mexico ","ccode":"mx","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-30","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Spanish"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"65","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2020-01-26","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-13","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

Their exceptional martial arts skills allows them to reach the highest rank within the imperial guards. After a successful attempt to kill a Japanese troop leader, the Emperor orders Ying to escort the Golden Wheel of Time from Sindu back to the capital, which is said to have the power of time travel and foresee into the future. From the correspondence between Japanese and Ming officials seized from the mission, Mr. Tu - the Chief of National Defence - reveals that he can identify the traitor by the handwritings. On the way of escorting the Golden Wheel of Time in the snow, Ying is surprisingly confronted by Sao, Yuanlong and Niehu. They inform Ying the news of the murder of Tu&amp;#39;s family with Ying as the killer. The Emperor believes that Ying killed Tu in order to conceal his identity as the traitor, and orders to have Ying and his clan killed. With the Trio sent out to catch Ying, a separate troop is sent to Taoyuan to kill the villagers. From the evidence presented to Ying, he comes to the conclusion that the traitor has to be one of the trio and also the one behind the ruthless killing. Desperate to save the Taoyuan villagers, Ying chooses to fight his way out. The intensity of the duel has shaken the earth causing an avalanche that buries the four during the heat of battle. Now in 2013, Squire Tang, funded by a mysterious financer, digs up Ying, Sao and Niehu. As he is transferring the icemen to Hong Kong for further studies, the vehicle is involved in a traffic accident which, unexpectedly, defrosts Ying. Frozen for 400 years arriving to modern day Hong Kong, Ying accidentally meets an intoxicated woman named May on Halloween evening, who later gives him shelter. With his intelligence and hard-work, Ying soon becomes more familiar with the idea of modern society with the help of the internet. While adapting to his new life, Ying and May also gradually starts to fall for each other. Ying still never forgets about the injustice that framed him. He comes across a historical record on the internet stating that he plotted a revolt which branded him with the reputation of a traitor in history. However, there is no information regarding the fate of the villagers. For Ying to correct history, he must use the Golden Wheel of Time. However, Sao and Niehu are now also reanimated at present time. They continue to take up the chase they left behind in the past, eventually leading to several showdowns around Hong Kong.","country":"China, Hong Kong","language":"Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Hindi","imdbid":"tt2557256"},"mgname":["Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","International Movies","Epics","International Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Chinese Films","International Action & Adventure","Sci-Fi Adventure","Asian Movies","Martial Arts Films","Adventures","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["1492","1568","9744","78367","52858","852491","3960","852490","6926","78104","8985","7442","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Donnie Yen","Shengyi Huang","Mark Wu","Baoqiang Wang","Singh Hartihan Bitto","Suet Lam","Kang Yu","Simon Yam","Yu Kang","Wang Baoqiang","Lam Suet"]},{"creator":["Fung Lam","Mark Wu"]},{"director":["Wing-cheong Law","Law Wing-cheong"]}],"country":[]}}

His highly controversial experiments have made him famous, but they have also made him the prime target of anti-technology extremists who will do whatever it takes to stop him. However, in their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed-to be a participant in his own transcendence. For his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) and best friend Max Waters (Paul Bettany), both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should.

This includes abruptly abandoning his girlfriend who has no idea what is going on. The assassination, paid for by a foreign mining company, triggers wide spread chaos and death in an already inflamed Congo. Terrier returns to the Congo years later working for an NGO, but eventually finds himself to be the target of a paid hit squad somehow connected to the ministers assassination.

In trying to discover who has put a price on his head, he begins to reconnect to the members of his old assassination team, including his old girlfriend. Always aware there is no path to redemption for his crimes, he is also periodically incapacitated by a type of accumulated and evolving physical brain damage caused by the hard knocks of his occupation. Unexpectedly, given the time that has elapsed, his reconnection to his old assassination team exposes additional intrigues with immediate deadly consequences.

Rebecca&amp;#39;s 11th birthday is here, and she wants the gift she wants every year, a cat. Tom hates cats, but he is without a gift and time is running out. His GPS directs him to a mystical pet store brimming with odd and exotic cats- where the store&amp;#39;s eccentric owner- Felix Perkins (Christopher Walken), presents him with a majestic tomcat, named Mr. Fuzzypants. En route to present his daughter with her dream pet, a bizarre turn of events finds Tom trapped inside the body of Mr. Fuzzypants.

Waters and his elite squadron of tactical specialists are forced to choose between their duty and their humanity, between following orders by ignoring the conflict that surrounds them, or finding the courage to follow their conscience and protect a group of innocent refugees. When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0314353"},"mgname":["Dramas","Military Dramas","Action Thrillers","Military Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5763","11","43048","2125","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Bruce Willis","Johnny Messner","Chad Smith","Eamonn Walker","Tom Skerritt","Charles Ingram","Malick Bowens","Monica Bellucci","Cole Hauser","Nick Chinlund","Paul Francis","Awaovieyi Agie"]},{"creator":["Alex Lasker","Patrick Cirillo"]},{"director":["Antoine Fuqua"]}],"country":[{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"}]}}

Their fascination still remains as they try to piece together the entire story. The sisters were mysteries if only because of having a strict and overprotective upbringing by their father, who taught math at the girls&amp;#39; private co-ed school, and overly devout Catholic mother, who largely dictated the household rules. The story focuses primarily on two incidents and the resulting situations on the girls&amp;#39; lives. The first was an action by Cecilia to deal with her emotions over her life. And the second was the relationship between Lux - the sister who pushed the boundaries of the household rules most overtly in doing what most teenagers want to do - and Trip Fontaine, he who could have any girl he wanted but wanting solely Lux.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0159097"},"mgname":["Independent Dramas","Dramas","20th Century Period Pieces","Independent Films","Dramas based on a book","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Crime Dramas"],"Genreid":["384","5763","12739","7077","4961","12994","6889"],"people":[{"actor":["James Woods","Kirsten Dunst","Josh Hartnett","Kathleen Turner","Scott Glenn","Michael Par&eacute;","A.J.

Curt, who received a lucrative local scholarship, is seen as the promise that their class holds. But Curt is having second thoughts about leaving what Steve basically sees as their dead end town.

As Curt tries to find that blonde while trying to get away from a local gang who have him somewhat hostage, Curt may come to a decision about his immediate future.

So his creator, Geppetto makes him a cake to celebrate. After a visit from the Pinocchio&amp;#39;s Fairy Godmother (who had turned Pinocchio into a real boy), Geppetto realizes that he must deliver a precious Jewel box to the Mayor. Pinocchio persuades Geppetto to allow to take the box and makes his way to the Mayor&amp;#39;s house. Pinocchio also takes with him his hand-make glow worm, which magically becomes real when Pincoccho gets distracted by a Carnival that has come to town. Pinocchio names his glow worm Willikers and decides to take a peek at the Carnival, despite Geppetto telling him not to go anywhere near it. Nearby, Scalawag and his colleague Igor advertise a three-shell game which cheats people out of their money, leading to Scalawag&amp;#39;s and Igor&amp;#39;s escape by using a cannon to get away from the angry mob. Scalawag meets Pinocchio and trades the Jewel box a ruby, which turns out to be a fake when Pinocchio gets home, which angers Geppetto. Pinocchio runs away to the Carnival where he watches a performance, and falls in love with the star puppet, Twinkle. After the people leave, the Puppet Master, Puppetino, tells Pinnochio about what it takes to be a performer, then transforms him into a puppet in an evil fashion. With help from Willikers and the Fairy Godmother, Pinocchio eventually escapes from the Carnvial to find the Jewel box, promising Twinkle along the way that he will find a way to make her real as well. Pinocchio meets with Scalawag and Igor and demands the Jewel box. Scalawag tells Pinocchio that he does not have it and says that they were outnumbered by a gang of thieves lead by Puppetino who took it. Pinocchio decides to track down the Carnival and Scalawag vows to help him go after it to get the box back, secretly intending to hand him over to Puppetino in exchange for gold. The Carnival, however, is a a lot more mysterious and evil than it seems. Including the evil master of the Carnival - the Emperor of the Night.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0093743"},"mgname":["Children & Family Movies","Kids Music","Movies based on Books","Family Sci-Fi & Fantasy"],"Genreid":["783","52843","9889","52849"],"people":[{"actor":["Rickie Lee Jones","Tom Bosley","Scott Grimes","Edward Asner","Jonathan Harris","Linda Gary","Don Knotts","James Earl Jones","Lana Beeson"]},{"creator":["Robby London","Barry O&amp;#39;Brien","Dennis O&amp;#39;Flaherty","Carlo Collodi"]},{"director":["Hal Sutherland"]}],"country":[]}}

The snake slithers into the front of the truck, kills the driver with its bite and then moves off into the forest. Flash forward to 1999. The small southern California town of San Vicente has grown from 6,000 to 30,000, and the rattler, which escaped nearby years ago, has bred. There are now 25,000 of these hybrid rattlesnakes, and they are slowly making their way downhill into the town, attracted by the movement of the blasting as the town paves its way toward progress. Progress, in this case, brings terror, in this tale originally penned by John Carpenter.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0203139"},"mgname":["US Movies","Horror Movies","Thrillers"],"Genreid":["1159493","8711","8933"],"people":[{"actor":["David Spielberg","Patty McCormack","Beau Billingslea","Jack Scalia","Harry Hamlin","Phillip Troy Linger","David Webb","Shannon Sturges","Carolyn Bock","David Whitney","Dominic Purcell"]},{"creator":["John Carpenter","William S.

The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection.

Ever since she saw Bryce&amp;#39;s dazzling brown eyes back in second grade, Juli has been smitten. Unfortunately, Bryce has never felt the same. Frankly, he thinks Juli Baker is a little weird--after all, what kind of freak raises chickens and sits in trees for fun? Then, in eighth grade, everything changes. Bryce begins to see that Juli&amp;#39;s unusual interests and pride in her family are, well, kind of cool. And Juli starts to think that maybe Bryce&amp;#39;s dazzling brown eyes are as empty as the rest of Bryce seems to be. After all, what kind of jerk doesn&amp;#39;t care about other people&amp;#39;s feelings about chickens and trees? With Flipped, mystery author Wendelin Van Draanen has taken a break from her Sammy Keyes series, and the result is flipping fantastic. Bryce and Juli&amp;#39;s rants and raves about each other ring so true that teen readers will quickly identify with at least one of these hilarious feuding egos, if not both.

Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug&amp;#39;s two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy&amp;#39;s brother Alan Garner - hop into Tracy&amp;#39;s father&amp;#39;s beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he&amp;#39;s with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. Because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to her about the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her, against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn&amp;#39;t be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they can&amp;#39;t find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not find Doug at all before the wedding.","country":"USA, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1119646"},"mgname":["Comedies"],"Genreid":["6548"],"people":[{"actor":["Jeffrey Tambor","Zach Galifianakis","Sasha Barrese","Ken Jeong","Ed Helms","Justin Bartha","Bradley Cooper","Mike Tyson","Rachael Harris","Heather Graham"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["Todd Phillips"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-21","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English -

Unfortunately Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990, six years earlier than expected, and is arrested and locked up in a mental institution, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert.","country":"USA","language":"English, French","imdbid":"tt0114746"},"mgname":["Thrillers","Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Sci-Fi Thrillers","Psychological Thrillers"],"Genreid":["8933","1492","11014","5505"],"people":[{"actor":["Bruce Willis","Joseph Melito","Michael Chance","Madeleine Stowe","Christopher Plummer","Brad Pitt","Jon Seda","Frank Gorshin","Bill Raymond","Ernest Abuba","Simon Jones"]},{"creator":["Chris Marker","Janet Peoples"]},{"director":["Terry Gilliam"]}],"country":[{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Czech","English","Polish"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"","new":"2017-10-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Turkish"],"subs":["Greek","English","Turkish"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Hungarian","Romanian"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Hindi"],"subs":["English","Hindi"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Lithuania ","ccode":"lt","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["English","Russian"],"cid":"357","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish","Russian"],"subs":["English","Polish","Russian","Ukrainian"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Polish","Turkish"],"subs":["English","European Spanish","Hungarian","Romanian","Turkish"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["English","Finnish","Russian"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["Czech","English","Hungarian","Polish","Ukrainian"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Hindi"],"subs":["English","Hindi"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2018-11-22","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"}]}}

Danny knows the odds makers-they depend on her for the inside story. And Danny knows that things are going to go nowhere for Uncle Eddie unless he can make his name with one great horse, a horse &amp;#39;you can ride into the money.&amp;#39; Danny has found such a horse. Tom Thumb, a yearling up for sale, has champion potential and she knows it. She isn&amp;#39;t fooled by Noel Ferguson, a big-time trainer who is talking Tom Thumb down. And when Moe Tully arrives in town, Danny knows it can only mean one thing-that races are going to be fixed. But there&amp;#39;s opportunity in that for her. Placing her bets before school and picking up her winnings after, she is soon able to bankroll Uncle Eddie, along with her friend Gerald, a groom at a competing stable who is ready to stake his savings on Tom Thumb. When Danny&amp;#39;s hunch proves correct and Tom Thumb turns out to be a winner, she, Uncle Eddie, and Gerald head off in style for the summer racing season. Other owners seek out the &amp;#39;Bara magic&amp;#39; and for awhile Uncle Eddie can do no wrong. It&amp;#39;s no surprise when Noel Ferguson offers Eddie fifty thousand dollars for Tom Thumb and tells him he&amp;#39;ll take it if he knows what&amp;#39;s good for him. When Eddie refuses, he and Danny, Gerald and even Tom Thumb get a dose of all the dirty dealing the racing circuit can dish out. But Danny, as we&amp;#39;ve seen, is nobody&amp;#39;s fool, and even Uncle Eddie has picked up a thing or two lately. In spite of just about everything that comes their way, they&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;in the money&amp;#39; and it&amp;#39;s one great season on the racing circuit.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0113330"},"mgname":["Dramas","Animal Tales","Children & Family Movies"],"Genreid":["5763","5507","783"],"people":[{"actor":["Erik Jensen","Brian Michael","Ron Brice","Ed Grady","Gary Basaraba","Leelee Sobieski","Karen Carlson","Ed Bruce","Robert Urich"]},{"creator":["Remi Aubuchon"]},{"director":["Dick Lowry"]}],"country":[]}}

Participants are flown to Los Angeles first class, paid $1,500, and put up for four nights in a luxury hotel. Suitable participants are deemed to be younger, muscular males. The event is held on a monthly basis. In contacting the organizers, US-based Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media, via their popular Facebook to arrange for an interview, David receives a return message from one of their representatives, Debbie J. Kuhn, declining the offer, the message a homophobic rant largely against David. In that message, Debbie asserts that the competition is wholly a heterosexual athletic activity, she who does not appreciate what will be David&amp;#39;s assumed gay bent on the story as a homosexual himself (which David does not state he is or isn&amp;#39;t in his request). David finds the message all the more odd as the activity as it appears in the videos has an undeniable gay vibe. What is even more odd is that Debbie on behalf of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien, continually emails David over the following weeks expounding on the themes in the original message. At this time, David&amp;#39;s friend, Dylan Reeve, enters the fray, acting initially as a researcher for David, and then eventually as co-filmmaker for a documentary on the subject. However, the documentary eventually morphs from the sport of competitive endurance tickling into the mysterious world of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien and Debbie Kuhn, especially: as they seem to have unlimited resources both to hold the events and to conduct their online harassment they learn not only of David, but of former associates who now seem to want to distance themselves from the &amp;#39;sport&amp;#39; and Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media; as Jane and Debbie initiate legal action and threaten even more legal action, and issue general threats time and time against David and Dylan not only for this unauthorized documentary but for their activities toward Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media as a whole; and as no one seems to know who Debbie or Jane are, even the people that work for them, or what their end goal is. The story takes a further twist when David and Dylan learn there truly is a tickling sexual fetish subculture, one within that community, Richard Ivey, who willingly talks to David and who remembers someone else online decades ago within the community with a similar M.O. to Debbie and Jane.","country":"New Zealand","language":"English","imdbid":"tt5278506"},"mgname":["Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Dylan Reeve","David Farrier","David Starr","Hal Karp"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["David Farrier","Dylan Reeve"]}],"country":[]}}

The film focuses on the heroic efforts of various Rangers to get to the downed black hawks, centering on SSG Eversmann, leading the Ranger unit Chalk Four to the first black hawk crash site, Chief Warrant Officer Durant who was captured after being the only survivor of the second black hawk crash, as well as many others who were involved.","country":"USA, UK","language":"English, Somali, Arabic","imdbid":"tt0265086"},"mgname":["Dramas","Military Dramas","Military Action & Adventure","Dramas based on a book","Action & Adventure","Dramas based on real life"],"Genreid":["5763","11","2125","4961","1365","3653"],"people":[{"actor":["Danny Hoch","Brendan Sexton III","Zeljko Ivanek","William Fichtner","Charlie Hofheimer","Ron Eldard","Ewen Bremner","Eric Bana","Jason Isaacs","Tom Sizemore","Glenn Morshower","Jeremy Piven","Tom Guiry","Josh Hartnett","Sam Shepard","Ioan Gruffudd","Hugh Dancy","Ewan McGregor","Gabriel Casseus","Kim Coates"]},{"creator":["Mark Bowden","Ken Nolan"]},{"director":["Ridley Scott"]}],"country":[{"country":"Brazil ","ccode":"br","seasons":"","new":"2018-03-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","Spanish","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"cid":"29","islive":"yes"},{"country":"France ","ccode":"fr","seasons":"","new":"2017-10-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["Arabic","English","European Spanish","French","Portuguese"],"cid":"45","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Greece ","ccode":"gr","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-28","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","French","Turkish"],"subs":["Greek","English","French","Turkish"],"cid":"327","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-21","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Polish","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Romanian","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-28","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Italian","Russian"],"subs":["Greek","English","French","Italian","Romanian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Portugal ","ccode":"pt","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["English","European Spanish","French","Portuguese"],"cid":"268","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Malay","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Spain ","ccode":"es","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","French","Italian","Brazilian Portuguese"],"subs":["Arabic","English","European Spanish","French","Romanian"],"cid":"270","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Sweden ","ccode":"se","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-05","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","French"],"subs":["Danish","English","Finnish","Norwegian","Swedish"],"cid":"73","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Malay","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

The grandson is sure he won&amp;#39;t like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and &amp;#39;no kissing&amp;#39;. But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn&amp;#39;t want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of &amp;#39;as you wish&amp;#39; to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups.

Now, former CIA assassin Mitch Leary is stalking the current President, who is running for re-election. Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan, telling him of his plans to kill the President. Leary plans to kill the president because Leary feels betrayed by the government -- Leary was removed from the CIA, and the CIA is now trying to have him killed. After talking to Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty, working with fellow secret service agent Lilly Raines. Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around, and he&amp;#39;s more than willing to take a bullet. White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent refuses to alter the President&amp;#39;s itinerary, while Horrigan&amp;#39;s boss, Secret Service Director Sam Campagna, is supportive of Horrigan. As the election gets closer, Horrigan begins to doubt his own abilities, especially when Horrigan&amp;#39;s colleague Al D&amp;#39;Andrea is killed by Leary.

Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster awaits the return of Thor although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall, who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor&amp;#39;s mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki. Unfortunately, Loki&amp;#39;s motivations remain unknown.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1981115"},"mgname":["Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","Action Thrillers","Comic Book and Superhero Films","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["1492","1568","9744","43048","10118","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Chris Hemsworth","Natalie Portman","Tom Hiddleston","Anthony Hopkins","Richard Brake","Richard Wharton","Tadanobu Asano","Jonathan Howard","Zachary Levi","Rene Russo","Brett Tucker","Christopher Eccleston","Steve Scott","Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd","Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje","Kat Dennings","Alice Krige","Clive Russell","Talulah Riley","Sam Swainsbury","Ray Stevenson","Stan Lee","Jaimie Alexander","Royce Pierreson","Chris ODowd","Idris Elba"]},{"creator":["Christopher Markus","Stephen McFeely","Don Payne","Robert Rodat","Stan Lee","Larry Lieber","Jack Kirby"]},{"director":["Alan Taylor"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-02","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Tamil"],"subs":["English","Malay","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-18","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Tamil"],"subs":["English","Malay","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Their exceptional martial arts skills allows them to reach the highest rank within the imperial guards. After a successful attempt to kill a Japanese troop leader, the Emperor orders Ying to escort the Golden Wheel of Time from Sindu back to the capital, which is said to have the power of time travel and foresee into the future. From the correspondence between Japanese and Ming officials seized from the mission, Mr. Tu - the Chief of National Defence - reveals that he can identify the traitor by the handwritings. On the way of escorting the Golden Wheel of Time in the snow, Ying is surprisingly confronted by Sao, Yuanlong and Niehu. They inform Ying the news of the murder of Tu&amp;#39;s family with Ying as the killer. The Emperor believes that Ying killed Tu in order to conceal his identity as the traitor, and orders to have Ying and his clan killed. With the Trio sent out to catch Ying, a separate troop is sent to Taoyuan to kill the villagers. From the evidence presented to Ying, he comes to the conclusion that the traitor has to be one of the trio and also the one behind the ruthless killing. Desperate to save the Taoyuan villagers, Ying chooses to fight his way out. The intensity of the duel has shaken the earth causing an avalanche that buries the four during the heat of battle. Now in 2013, Squire Tang, funded by a mysterious financer, digs up Ying, Sao and Niehu. As he is transferring the icemen to Hong Kong for further studies, the vehicle is involved in a traffic accident which, unexpectedly, defrosts Ying. Frozen for 400 years arriving to modern day Hong Kong, Ying accidentally meets an intoxicated woman named May on Halloween evening, who later gives him shelter. With his intelligence and hard-work, Ying soon becomes more familiar with the idea of modern society with the help of the internet. While adapting to his new life, Ying and May also gradually starts to fall for each other. Ying still never forgets about the injustice that framed him. He comes across a historical record on the internet stating that he plotted a revolt which branded him with the reputation of a traitor in history. However, there is no information regarding the fate of the villagers. For Ying to correct history, he must use the Golden Wheel of Time. However, Sao and Niehu are now also reanimated at present time. They continue to take up the chase they left behind in the past, eventually leading to several showdowns around Hong Kong.","country":"China, Hong Kong","language":"Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Hindi","imdbid":"tt2557256"},"mgname":["Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Action Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Fantasy","International Movies","Epics","International Sci-Fi & Fantasy","Chinese Films","International Action & Adventure","Sci-Fi Adventure","Asian Movies","Martial Arts Films","Adventures","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["1492","1568","9744","78367","52858","852491","3960","852490","6926","78104","8985","7442","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Donnie Yen","Shengyi Huang","Mark Wu","Baoqiang Wang","Singh Hartihan Bitto","Suet Lam","Kang Yu","Simon Yam","Yu Kang","Wang Baoqiang","Lam Suet"]},{"creator":["Fung Lam","Mark Wu"]},{"director":["Wing-cheong Law","Law Wing-cheong"]}],"country":[]}}

The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), to help with her family troubles.","country":"USA, Australia, UK","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1077368"},"mgname":["International Comedies","Comedies","International Movies"],"Genreid":["852492","6548","78367"],"people":[{"actor":["Chloe Grace Moretz","Helena Bonham Carter","Michelle Pfeiffer","Johnny Depp","Bella Heathcote","Eva Green","Gulliver McGrath","Jonny Lee Miller","Christopher Lee","Jackie Earle Haley","Ray Shirley"]},{"creator":["Seth Grahame-Smith","John August","Dan Curtis"]},{"director":["Tim Burton"]}],"country":[{"country":"Belgium ","ccode":"be","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"26","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Czech Republic ","ccode":"cz","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"307","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Germany ","ccode":"de","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"39","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Hungary ","ccode":"hu","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"334","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Israel ","ccode":"il","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["Arabic","English","Hebrew","Russian"],"cid":"336","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-11","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Japanese"],"subs":["English","Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2019-07-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Poland ","ccode":"pl","seasons":"","new":"2017-09-23","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Polish"],"subs":["English","Polish"],"cid":"392","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Portugal ","ccode":"pt","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-15","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Portuguese"],"cid":"268","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Romania ","ccode":"ro","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Romanian"],"cid":"400","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Russia","ccode":"ru","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-06","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Russian"],"subs":["English","Russian"],"cid":"402","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Slovakia ","ccode":"sk","seasons":"","new":"2016-01-07","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"412","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Africa","ccode":"za","seasons":"","new":"2019-02-27","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"447","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2016-02-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Spain ","ccode":"es","seasons":"","new":"2019-03-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","European Spanish"],"subs":["English","European Spanish"],"cid":"270","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Switzerland ","ccode":"ch","seasons":"","new":"2019-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English [Original]"],"subs":["German","English"],"cid":"34","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United Kingdom","ccode":"gb","seasons":"","new":"2019-05-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"46","islive":"yes"}]}}

The parents have passed their ideals to their children, namely socialism (in its various forms) and survivalism. With the former, Ben considers most of western society as being fascist, especially corporate America. With the latter, he figures that no one will or should be there for you, so you better learn how to take care of yourself in all its aspects. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training, know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains and even fractures, and know how to hunt, forage and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie&amp;#39;s health. Formerly a lawyer, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben figures that this disorder started with her post-partum depression with Bo. Even with this lifestyle, Leslie&amp;#39;s condition has become progressively worse. Despite not believing in western medicine, Ben, to deal with the illness, has sent Leslie to hospital, one close to Ben&amp;#39;s sister, Harper, in Sacramento so that there can be family close by. While in hospital, Leslie is able to commit suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie&amp;#39;s act brings out a battle between Ben, and Leslie&amp;#39;s father, Jack Bertrang, a wealthy Christian, who not only blames Ben for what happened to Leslie, but believes what he is doing to the children can legally be considered abuse. To be held in their church in New Mexico, Jack takes over the funeral arrangements to his and his complacent wife Abby&amp;#39;s Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie&amp;#39;s wishes, she who believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, he and the children believe it is the latest of their missions to rescue Leslie to honor her last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophies. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long seated issues within the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he who may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.","country":"USA","language":"English, Esperanto","imdbid":"tt3553976"},"mgname":["Independent Comedies","Cannes Film Festival Award-winning Movies","Award-winning Movies","Comedies","Independent Movies"],"Genreid":["4195","846810","89844","6548","7077"],"people":[{"actor":["Nicholas Hamilton","Ann Dowd","Missi Pyle","Steve Zahn","Samantha Isler","George MacKay","Trin Miller","Annalise Basso","Kathryn Hahn","Frank Langella","Erin Moriarty","Viggo Mortensen","Charlie Shotwell","Shree Crooks"]},{"creator":["Matt Ross"]},{"director":["Matt Ross"]}],"country":[{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"}]}}

Both Fiona and Marcus beat to their own respective drummers. Marcus will do whatever he can to make his depressed mother happy, even if it causes himself grief. As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids don&amp;#39;t want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it. Meanwhile, thirty-eight year old Will Freeman is a slacker who has lived comfortably off the royalties of a song written by his deceased father, and as such has never had to work a day in his life. He is a solitary man who places himself as the first and only priority in life. He comes across the idea that dating single moms meets his selfish carnal needs. It is in this capacity that Will meets Marcus, as one of Will&amp;#39;s single mother conquests, Suzie, is friends with the Brewers. Trying to escape his life but wanting Will to date Fiona, Marcus infiltrates Will&amp;#39;s life, much to Will&amp;#39;s chagrin. Will slowly begins to realize that Marcus is more than just a nuisance, but rather someone who needs some guidance navigating through the trials of adolescence and the trials of dealing with a suicidal mother, and perhaps he can be a small part of providing that direction. Conversely, Marcus may be able to show Will the path to becoming a real adult.","country":"UK, USA, France, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0276751"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Romantic Dramas","British Films","Comedies","Romantic Favourites","Romantic Films","Dramas based on contemporary literature","Romantic Comedies"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","1255","10757","6548","502675","8883","12994","5475"],"people":[{"actor":["Toni Collette","Nicholas Hoult","Hugh Grant","Sharon Small","Rachel Weisz","Nicholas Hutchison","Isabel Brook","Victoria Smurfit","Madison Cook","Natalia Tena"]},{"creator":["Nick Hornby","Peter Hedges","Paul Weitz"]},{"director":["Paul Weitz","Chris Weitz"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","Spanish","French","Italian"],"subs":["German","English","Spanish","French","Italian"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Netherlands ","ccode":"nl","seasons":"","new":"2018-09-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"67","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Turkey ","ccode":"tr","seasons":"","new":"2019-10-16","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["German","English - Audio Description","English [Original]","European Spanish","Turkish"],"subs":["German","English","European Spanish","Indonesian","Dutch"],"cid":"432","islive":"yes"}]}}

Waters and his elite squadron of tactical specialists are forced to choose between their duty and their humanity, between following orders by ignoring the conflict that surrounds them, or finding the courage to follow their conscience and protect a group of innocent refugees. When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator, Waters, a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician, Dr. Lena Kendricks. Dr. Kendricks, an American citizen by marriage, is tending to the victims of the ongoing civil war at a Catholic mission in a remote village. When Waters arrives, however, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are won over to Dr. Kendricks&amp;#39; cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot, Waters&amp;#39; team, experts at evasion and concealment, are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that, among the refugees, is the sole survivor of the country&amp;#39;s previous ruling family, whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs. Waters and his small band of soldiers must weigh the life of one man against their own and the refugees they feel obliged to protect.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0314353"},"mgname":["Dramas","Military Dramas","Action Thrillers","Military Action & Adventure","Action & Adventure"],"Genreid":["5763","11","43048","2125","1365"],"people":[{"actor":["Bruce Willis","Johnny Messner","Chad Smith","Eamonn Walker","Tom Skerritt","Charles Ingram","Malick Bowens","Monica Bellucci","Cole Hauser","Nick Chinlund","Paul Francis","Awaovieyi Agie"]},{"creator":["Alex Lasker","Patrick Cirillo"]},{"director":["Antoine Fuqua"]}],"country":[{"country":"Italy ","ccode":"it","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-14","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Italian"],"subs":["Italian"],"cid":"269","islive":"yes"}]}}

In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney&amp;#39;s plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn&amp;#39;t budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.","country":"USA, UK, Australia","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2140373"},"mgname":["Dramas","Biographical Dramas","Comedies","Dramas based on real life"],"Genreid":["5763","3179","6548","3653"],"people":[{"actor":["Emma Thompson","Tom Hanks","Annie Rose Buckley","Colin Farrell","B.J.

Soon after his fianc&eacute;e Carla Pestalozzi announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack. Womack tells Stanley that San Francisco&amp;#39;s Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel who, for years, has been protesting the government&amp;#39;s refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he&amp;#39;s holding hostages in order to get his point across. Stanley is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Stanley knows how to disarm the bombs, but Stanley needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside. That man is former British intelligence agent John Patrick Mason, who has been in prison for the past 30 years without a trial because he was accused of stealing the private files of J. Edgar Hoover. In 1962, John became the only inmate ever to escape from Alcatraz, and he stayed out of Alcatraz long enough to father a daughter named Jade Angelou. Despite his extreme hatred of the FBI, John agrees to help Stanley.

At the center of it all is the rise, fall and redemption of Freeway Rick Ross, a street hustler who became the King of Crack, and journalist Gary Webb, who broke the story of the CIA&amp;#39;s complicity in the drug war. Featuring exclusive interviews with Freeway Rick Ross, not to be confused with the rapper who took his name Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gary Webb, his source Coral Baca, and wife Susan Webb former Los Angeles Deputy Sheriff Roberto Juarez drug trafficker Julio Zavala and many more. The real Rick Ross is not a rapper. He&amp;#39;s an urban legend in South Central LA, a black godfather figure whom most people have never seen, but know by name and reputation. He&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Freeway&amp;#39; Rick Ross, the man who stood at the center of the crack epidemic, and whose name has been inextricably linked to the CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection.

However, something that sounds so simple, is rarely so. Joined by two new team members, Caterina Boldieu, an ex- DGSE agent and later in the series, Jules Faroux, a computer and mechanical whizz, Frank is hired to deliver a diverse range of packages - from pop princesses to priceless paintings. Frank Martin takes the jobs no other transporter will touch or can achieve - simply because they are too challenging and the odds seemingly insurmountable. That is why he is considered the best transporter in the world. Frank&amp;#39;s jobs take him to many beautiful locations around the world, but they also draw him into danger and mystery. And more often than not, solving that mystery will lead Frank to successfully completing his mission. However Frank&amp;#39;s jobs aren&amp;#39;t solely about the packages he must deliver but also about the people he meets. While his emphasis is always on completing the mission, Frank is unable to avoid the human emotions that come with dealing with clients in difficult situations - no matter how hard he tries. Transporter - The Series: Season 2 is an exciting, emotional, witting, adrenaline-fuelled twelve part series which will have the audience sitting on the edge of their seats as Frank drives them (sometimes quite literally!) through the twists and turns of each episode.","country":"Canada, France, USA, Germany","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1885102"},"mgname":["TV Action & Adventure","TV Programmes","Police TV Shows"],"Genreid":["10673","83","75392"],"people":[{"actor":["Chris Vance","Francois Berleand","Charly Hubner","Delphine Chaneac","Violante Placido","Andrea Osvart"]},{"creator":["Robert Mark Kamen","Luc Besson"]},{"director":[]}],"country":[]}}

Braddock--a.k.a. the Cinderella Man--was to become one of the most surprising sports legends in history. By the early 1930s, the impoverished ex-prizefighter was seemingly as broken-down, beaten-up and out-of-luck as much of the rest of the American populace who had hit rock bottom. His career appeared to be finished, he was unable to pay the bills, the only thing that mattered to him--his family--was in danger, and he was even forced to go on Public Relief. But deep inside, Jim Braddock never relinquished his determination. Driven by love, honor and an incredible dose the ones who are do of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. No one thought he had a shot. However Braddock, fueled by something beyond mere competition, kept winning. Suddenly, the ordinary working man became the mythic athlete. Carrying the hopes and dreams of the disenfranchised on his shoulders, Braddock rocketed through the ranks, until this underdog chose to do the unthinkable: take on the heavyweight champ of the world, the unstoppable Max Baer, renowned for having killed two men in the ring.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt0352248"},"mgname":["Romantic Dramas","Romantic Films","Sports Dramas","Biographical Dramas","Dramas","Dramas based on real life"],"Genreid":["1255","8883","7243","3179","5763","3653"],"people":[{"actor":["Craig Bierko","Paddy Considine","Ron Canada","Bruce McGill","Connor Price","Renee Zellweger","Boyd Banks","Fulvio Cecere","Angelo Tsarouchas","Russell Crowe","Paul Giamatti"]},{"creator":["Cliff Hollingsworth","Akiva Goldsman"]},{"director":["Ron Howard"]}],"country":[{"country":"Canada ","ccode":"ca","seasons":"","new":"2019-12-04","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]","Canadian French"],"subs":["English","Canadian French"],"cid":"33","islive":"yes"}]}}

Thomas Gates, Ben&amp;#39;s great-grandfather, is mentioned on the page. It shows that Ben&amp;#39;s great-grandfather was a co-conspirator in Abraham Lincoln&amp;#39;s murder. When doing more research, the conspiracy takes Ben, Abigail Chase, and Riley Poole to Buckingham Palace (which they break into). They discover a plank that has early Native American writing on it. The plank has only one symbol that Patrick Gates can identify. The symbol is Cibola (see-bowl-uh) meaning the City of Gold. In order to define the rest they have to go to Ben&amp;#39;s mother, Patrick&amp;#39;s divorced wife. After 32 years it brings back old arguments. After that the other clue is in the President&amp;#39;s desk in the Oval Office in the White House (which Ben and Abigail sneak into) to discover that the clue lies in The President&amp;#39;s Book. But in order to see the book, their choice is either get elected president or kidnap the President of the United States. Which do they choose? It&amp;#39;s obvious. With Wilkinson close on their tail, they find the book in the Library of Congress. The conspiracy then crosses to Mount Rushmore where the clue was on the hills, but (according to the Book) President Calvin Coolidge had the faces carved in so no one can find the City of Gold. When they get there they find out that they must work with Wilkinson since he has some clues of his own. Who will claim Cibola? And will the name of Gates be known as murder?","country":"USA","language":"English, French","imdbid":"tt0465234"},"mgname":["Family Features","Action Thrillers","Children & Family Films","Films for ages 8 to 10","Action & Adventure","Adventures"],"Genreid":["51056","43048","783","561","1365","7442"],"people":[{"actor":["Nicolas Cage","Justin Bartha","Diane Kruger","Jon Voight","Albert Hall","Emerson Brooks","Michael Stone Forrest","Ty Burrell","Christian Camargo","Demetri Goritsas","Harvey Keitel","Peter Woodward","Alicia Leigh Willis","Helen Mirren","Natalie Dreyfuss","David Ury","Michael Maize","Susan Beresford","Emily Joyce","Zachary Gordon","Brent Briscoe","Alicia Coppola","Larry Cedar","Richard Cutting","Timothy V.

Outwardly Charles built it so that they can spend time there to reconnect as a family, but they all know that he really built it to support the business. They as a family have long not been happy, as workaholic Charles is always concerned the company is close to folding, especially if he doesn&amp;#39;t keep an eye on matters, while Judith feels like he treats their entire family as second priority to the work and the associated money and material wealth. They make it to the cabin just before a major snowstorm hits the area. They receive a surprise knock on their door from the Tuckers - parents Joe and Amy, and their two children, fifteen year old Robbie and fourteen year old Lucie - who ran off the road in their van on their way to a day ski trip, they who need shelter until the storm blows over. Unlike the Montgomerys, the Tuckers are a loving, happy family, who support each other as a family unit. The Montgomerys and the Tuckers do bond during their confined time together, but the sheer presence of the Tuckers may not be enough in and of itself to demonstrate to the Montgomerys what they need to do to avert the break-up of their family.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt4480940"},"mgname":["Dramas","Dramas based on a book","Family Dramas","Children & Family Films","Family Features"],"Genreid":["5763","4961","31901","783","51056"],"people":[{"actor":["Catherine Lough Haggquist","Nick Purcha","Colin Lawrence","Lizzie Boys","Kolton Stewart","Chris Potter","Jaeda Lily  Miller","Kristy Swanson"]},{"creator":["Kenneth Atchity","Chi-Li Wong","Julie Brazier","Rexanne Becnel"]},{"director":["George Erschbamer"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-29","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Japanese","Korean","Portuguese","Simplified Chinese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Singapore ","ccode":"sg","seasons":"","new":"2017-12-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"408","islive":"yes"},{"country":"South Korea","ccode":"kr","seasons":"","new":"2018-10-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Korean"],"cid":"348","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Thailand ","ccode":"th","seasons":"","new":"2019-06-17","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Simplified Chinese","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"425","islive":"yes"}]}}

Dean, a high school drop out, comes from a broken home, where he never really had a mother figure. He never saw himself getting married or having a family despite falling in love at first sight with Cindy. He doesn&amp;#39;t have any professional ambition beyond his current work - which he enjoys since he feels he can knock off a beer at 8 o&amp;#39;clock in the morning without it affecting his work - although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life. Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family, with her own mother and father not setting an example of a harmonious married or family life. One of her previous serious relationships was with Bobby Ontario, that relationship which has a profound affect on many aspects of her marriage to Dean. Dean and Cindy head off on an overnight getaway together without Frankie, the getaway which may provide a clearer picture if their marriage can survive its many issues.","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt1120985"},"mgname":["Independent Dramas","Romantic Dramas","Dramas","Independent Films","Romantic Films"],"Genreid":["384","1255","5763","7077","8883"],"people":[{"actor":["Michelle Williams","Faith Wladyka","Marshall Johnson","Jen Jones","Barbara Troy","John Doman","Mike Vogel","Carey Westbrook","Enid Graham","Ryan Gosling","Maryann Plunkett","Ben Shenkman","James Benatti"]},{"creator":["Joey Curtis","Cami Delavigne"]},{"director":["Derek Cianfrance"]}],"country":[{"country":"Hong Kong ","ccode":"hk","seasons":"","new":"2018-06-21","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Traditional Chinese"],"cid":"331","islive":"yes"},{"country":"India ","ccode":"in","seasons":"","new":"2016-08-01","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English"],"cid":"337","islive":"yes"},{"country":"Japan ","ccode":"jp","seasons":"","new":"2019-04-26","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["Japanese"],"cid":"267","islive":"yes"},{"country":"United States","ccode":"us","seasons":"","new":"2018-07-05","expires":"","seasondet":[""],"audio":["English [Original]"],"subs":["English","Spanish"],"cid":"78","islive":"yes"}]}}

Participants are flown to Los Angeles first class, paid $1,500, and put up for four nights in a luxury hotel. Suitable participants are deemed to be younger, muscular males. The event is held on a monthly basis. In contacting the organizers, US-based Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media, via their popular Facebook to arrange for an interview, David receives a return message from one of their representatives, Debbie J. Kuhn, declining the offer, the message a homophobic rant largely against David. In that message, Debbie asserts that the competition is wholly a heterosexual athletic activity, she who does not appreciate what will be David&amp;#39;s assumed gay bent on the story as a homosexual himself (which David does not state he is or isn&amp;#39;t in his request). David finds the message all the more odd as the activity as it appears in the videos has an undeniable gay vibe. What is even more odd is that Debbie on behalf of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien, continually emails David over the following weeks expounding on the themes in the original message. At this time, David&amp;#39;s friend, Dylan Reeve, enters the fray, acting initially as a researcher for David, and then eventually as co-filmmaker for a documentary on the subject. However, the documentary eventually morphs from the sport of competitive endurance tickling into the mysterious world of Jane O&amp;#39;Brien and Debbie Kuhn, especially: as they seem to have unlimited resources both to hold the events and to conduct their online harassment they learn not only of David, but of former associates who now seem to want to distance themselves from the &amp;#39;sport&amp;#39; and Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media; as Jane and Debbie initiate legal action and threaten even more legal action, and issue general threats time and time against David and Dylan not only for this unauthorized documentary but for their activities toward Jane O&amp;#39;Brien Media as a whole; and as no one seems to know who Debbie or Jane are, even the people that work for them, or what their end goal is. The story takes a further twist when David and Dylan learn there truly is a tickling sexual fetish subculture, one within that community, Richard Ivey, who willingly talks to David and who remembers someone else online decades ago within the community with a similar M.O. to Debbie and Jane.","country":"New Zealand","language":"English","imdbid":"tt5278506"},"mgname":["Documentaries"],"Genreid":["6839"],"people":[{"actor":["Dylan Reeve","David Farrier","David Starr","Hal Karp"]},{"creator":[]},{"director":["David Farrier","Dylan Reeve"]}],"country":[]}}

And that is exactly what happens to firefighter Jeff Elliott and his wife Ruth who are living their dream in the golden Midwest; high school sweethearts, married with two beautiful and healthy children, family farm, horses, sports, church groups, the whole American Dream come true. And one winters day, teenage son Eric &amp;#39;Hoovey&amp;#39; Elliott collapses at high school basketball practice, is rushed to the hospital, and the doctors find a tumor the size of an orange at the base of his brain. They&amp;#39;re down to hours-if surgery that risks the boy&amp;#39;s ability to walk, talk, and perhaps even survive is not performed immediately, Hoovey&amp;#39;s young life will end before it truly even begins. In a grueling 8-hour procedure, the tumor is removed. And he survives. But for the Elliott family, life and dreams will never be the same. Hoovey has to teach himself to walk again, to read again, to even see straight with two unbalanced eyes, covered one at a time by an eye patch. Forget ever stepping on a basketball court - the risk of receiving a fatal blow to the spot on his head is just too great. As the unpaid medical bills mount, Jeff&amp;#39;s firefighting salary isn&amp;#39;t enough, the family is swimming in crippling debt seemingly overnight, everything he and Ruth have built in their life dream of two kids is at stake. Hoovey&amp;#39;s teenage sister Jen feels alone and nearly forgotten in the most important time of her life. And as Hoovey realizes his one dream in life-playing this game-is gone, too, he sinks into a deep sadness. This is a family at risk. With no-one to turn to, but themselves and their God. HOOVEY is the true and inspiring story of the Elliott family, who refused to surrender, instead turning to one another and their faith in the worst of circumstances, to rebuild their lives, their boy, and their dreams... together. Step by grueling step, with faith, love, and the tireless work of a mother and father to save their family, their farm, their dream, Hoovey learns to walk again. To read again. To dribble and shoot a basketball again. And yes, to dream again himself. Then stepping out in his faith, back onto the hard court, to live that dream of playing this game once more...","country":"USA","language":"English","imdbid":"tt2828884"},"mgname":["Faith & Spirituality","Faith & Spirituality Films","Tearjerkers","Dramas"],"Genreid":["26835","52804","6384","5763"],"people":[{"actor":["Alexandria Deberry","Stephen Baldwin","Lauren Holly","Cody Linley","Glenn Morshower","Charles Robinson","Brandon Mychal Smith","Patrick Warburton","Alyson Stoner"]},{"creator":["Howard Klausner"]},{"director":["Sean McNamara"]}],"country":[]}}
